<p>For example, here's how to search for issues with the word
<b>calculation</b> in the summary field.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="summary:calculation" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>When searching for issues owned by a specific user, you can use his
or her username. When referring to yourself, you can also use the
special term <b>me</b>. For example, this restricts the search to
issues that are owned by you.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="owner:username" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" >
</form>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="owner:me" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn"  value="Search" >
 </p>
</form>
<p>Rather than have a large number of predefined fields, our issue
tracker stores many issue details as labels.</p>
<p>For example, if you labeled security-related issues with the label
<b>Security</b>, here's how to search for them.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="label:security" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>In addition to simple one-word labels, you can use two part labels
that specify an attribute and a value, like <b>Priority-High</b>,
<b>Priority-Medium</b>, and <b>Priority-Low</b>. You can search for
these with the label: operator, or you can use the first part of the
label name like an operator.</p>
<p>For example, if you labeled high priority issues with
<b>Priority-High</b>, here's one way to search for them.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="label:Priority-High" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>And, here is a more compact way to do the same search.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="Priority:High" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>
You can search for issues that are blocked or blocking by using <b>blockedon:NNN</b> or
<b>blocking:NNN</b>. You can also search for issues that are blocked on anything with
<b>is:blocked</b>.
</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="is:blocked" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<h3>Empty (or non-empty) field search</h3>
<p>For each built-in field operator, you can use the 'has' operator to search for
issues with empty or non-empty fields.</p>
<p>For example, here's how to search for issues whose owner field is non-empty,
assigned to someone.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="has:owner" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" >
</form>
<p>Or, you can use '-has' operator for negation, to search for issues with empty
fields.</p>
<p>For example, here's how to search for issues whose owner field is empty
because no one is assigned to it.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="-has:owner" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" >
</form>
<h3>"OR" search</h3>
<p>Normally, each added search term narrows your search. If you would
like to find issues that include either of two terms, add an uppercase
"OR" between them.</p>
<p>For example, here's how to search for issues that are labeled with
either <b>Priority-High</b> or <b>Priority-Medium</b>.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="Priority:High OR Priority:Medium" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>A shorter way to search for two values for one field, or two labels
with the same prefix, is to use commas.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="Priority:High,Medium" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<h3>Exact value search</h3>
<p>You can search for issues that exactly match the given term by using
the search operator '='.</p>
<p>For example, searching for 'Milestone=2009' only matches issues with the
label 'Milestone-2009', while searching for 'Milestone:2009' matches issues
with the labels 'Milestone-2009', 'Milestone-2009-Q1', 'Milestone-2009-Q3',
etc.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="Milestone=2009" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<h3>Star search</h3>
<p>Any logged in user can mark any issue with a star. The star
indicates interest in the issue.</p>
<p>For example, to quickly see all the issues in this project that you
have starred, you could use the following:</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="is:starred" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn"  value="Search" >
 </p>
</form>
<p>And, to see the issues that at least three users have starred, use
the following:</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="stars:3" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<h3>Jump to issue and numeric search</h3>
<p>You can jump directly to a specific issue by entering its ID in the
search field.</p>
<p>For example, to jump to issue 1, just search for 1. If there is no
existing issue with that ID, the system will search for issues that
contain that number anywhere in the issue.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="1" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>If you just want to search for issues that contain the number 1, without
jumping to issue 1, enclose the number in quotation marks.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="&quot;1&quot;" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<h3>Attachment search</h3>
<p>Users can attach files to any issues, either when issues are created or as
part of issue comments.</p>
<p>To quickly see all the issues that have attachments, use the following:</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="has:attachment" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>Or, you can search for a specific filename of the attachment.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="attachment:screenshot" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>You can also search for the file extension of the attachment.</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="attachment:png" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<h3>Date range search</h3>
<p>You can perform searches based on date ranges.</p>
<p>This search syntax is divided into two parts, the action and the date,
[action]:[date]</p>
<p>Supported actions are: 'opened-after', 'opened-before',
'modified-after', 'modified-before', 'closed-after', and 'closed-before'.
And the date must to be specified as 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY/MM/DD' or 'today-N'.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to search for issues opened after 2009/4/1, you
could do the following:</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="opened-after:2009/4/1" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
<p>Or, if you want to search for issues modified 20 days before today's date,
you could do the following:</p>
<form action="list" method="GET">
 <p><input type="text" size="25" name="q" value="modified-before:today-20" >
 <input type="submit" name="btn" value="Search" ></p>
</form>
</div>
