Such diversity supports, and is necessary condition of, a democratic regime.', u'He stresses that by encouraging production and dissem, ination of works, copyright law helps to ensure that the body politic has the information it needs to participate in democratic processes. His reasoning applies not only to factual works but also to creative ones, on the grounds that "[m]any creative works have broad political and social implications even it they do not appear or even seek to convey an explicit ideological message."', u'When the Framers drafted the Copyright Clause and the Copyright Act of 1790, they took as self-evident that the diffusion of knowledge and exchange of view through a market for printed matter was a pillar of public liberty', u'democratic governance requires not, simply the diffusion of knowledge per se, but also an autonomous sphere of print-mediated citizen deliberations and public education. . . .

Beckett', u'In truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any, things, which, in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before. No man creates a new language for himself, at least if he be a wise man, in writing a book. He contents himself with the use of language already known and used and understood by others.  No man writes exclusively from his own thoughts, unaided and uninstructed by the thoughts of others. The thoughts of every man are, more or less, a combination of what other men have thought and expressed, although they may be modified, exalted; or improved by his own genius or reflection. If no book could be the subject of copy-right which was not new and original in the elements of which it is composed, there could be no ground for any copy-right in modern times, and we should be obliged to ascend very high, even in antiquity, to find a work entitled to such eminence. Virgil borrowed much from Homer; Bacon drew from earlier as well as contemporary minds; Coke exhausted all the known learning of his profession; and even Shakespeare and Milton, so justly and proudly our boast as the brightest originals would be found to have gathered much from the abundant stores of current knowledge and classical studies in their days.', u'Four years before his opinion in Emerson, in the case of Folsom v.

But this is not always true.', u"ever since the Supreme Court considered an 1882 portrait by the celebrity photographer Napoleon Sarony of the 27-year\xb7old Oscar Wilde, courts have articulated lists of potential components of a photograph's originality. These lists, however, are somewhat unsatisfactoty.", u"First, they do not deal with the issue, alluded to above, that the nature and extent of a photograph's protection differs depending on what makes that photograph original.", u'Second, courts have not always distinguished between decisions that a photographer makes in creating a photograph and the originality of the final product.', u'Decisions about film, camera, and lens, for example, often bear on whether an image is original.', u'But the fact that a photographer made such choices does not alone make the image original.', u'"Sweat of the brow" is not the touchstone of copyright.

See Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits, Inc., 225 F.3d 1068, 1077-1082 (9th Cir. 2000). Although the Ninth Circuit concluded that a photograph of a vodka bottle was not, a derivative work of the bottle, it reached that holding only after determining that the bottle was not independently copyrightable. Thus, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the bottle was not a preexisting work. Ets-Hokin, at 1077-1082. This Court respectfully believes that the Ets-Hokin court misconstrued the nature of derivative works. While the Ets-Hokin court correctly noted that a derivative work must be based on a "preexisting work," and that the term "work" refers to a "work of authorship" as set forth in 17 U.S.C. \xa7102(a), it failed to appreciate that any derivative work must recast, transform or adopt [sic] the authorship contained in the preexisting work. A photograph\' of Jeff Koons\' "Puppy" sculpture in Manhattan\'s Rockfeller Center, merely depicts that sculpture; it does not recast, transform, or adapt Koons\' sculptural authorship.

The clerk was required to maintain a book of record in which the title of the protected work would be entered", u'the Act required the author or proprietor to give notice of copyright to the public by publishing a copy of the record of copyright received from the clerk in at least one domestic newspaper within rwo months from the date of the record, and to maintain this newspaper notice for a period of four weeks.', u'1802, Congress amended the 1790 Act by adding another notice requirement.', u'Section 1 of the 1802 amendment required that the copy of record published in the newspapers also be inserted in the title page or in the page immediately following the title of every book.', u'1790 Act required that the author or proprietor deposit a copy of the work in the office of the Secretary of State within six months of its publication.', u'Each of these three formalities was essential to perfecting the title of the copyright owner under the 1790 Act.', u'first siguificant changes to the formalities required by copyright law occurred with passage of the Copyright Act of 1909.', u'This Act abandoned the requirement of notice in a newspaper, and provided that copyright protection would subsist upon publication of the work with proper notice of copyright artached to the work itself.', u'proper notice consisted of the word "Copyright" or "Copr.," and the name of the copyright proprietor.', u'Printed literary, musical, and dramatic works also had to include the year copyright was secured by publication, and notice had to appear on the title page or the page immediately following.', u'For all otherworks eligible for protection under the Act (maps, works of art such as models or designs and their reproductions, scientific or technical drawings, photographs and prints/pictorial illustra- tions), proper notice consisted of the symbol "\xa9" accompanied by an identifYing mark, symbol, or initials of the copyright owner.', u"the owner's full name had to appear on some accessible part of the work.", u'The Act demanded strict compliance', u'a copyright owner was entitled to register his or her claim with the Copyright Office and obtain a certificate of registration', u'Although registration was optional during the first term of the copyright, failure to register and deposit copies of the work created a bar to any action for copyright infringement.', u'the owner was required to register in order to receive a renewal term.', u'certain unpublished works that were "not reproduced for sale" could be registered, thus bringing such works under federal statutory protection.', u'Section 12 of the 1909 Act indicated that the types of unpublished works eligible for statutory', u'protection through registration were lectures and similar productions, dramatic compositioris~ muSical compositions, dramatico-musical compositions, motion picture photoplays, -motion pictures other than photoplays, photographs, works of art, and plastic works and drawings.', u'the 1909 Act did not provide a definition of "publication."', u'For example, it became settled case law that the public nature of a particular use of a copyrighted work, such as a public performance or public delivery of a lecture or speech, did not necessarily constitute a publication of the work.', u'Instead, "publication" seemed to turn on the degree to which a large number of people had both access to and control over multiple tangible copies of the work, or whether the public was given unrestricted access to copy the work.

CBS, Inc. 194 F.3d 1211 (11th Cir. 1999)', u'On September 30, 1963, approximately one month after the delivery of the Speech, Dr. King took steps to secure federal copyright protection for the Speech under the Copyright Act of 1909, and a certificate of registration of his claim to copyright was issued by the Copyright Office on October 2, 1963', u'Almost immediately thereafter, Dr. King filed suit in the Southern District ofNew York to enjoin the unauthorized sale of recordings of the Speech and won a preliminary injunction on December 13, 1963.', u'For the next twenry years, Dr. King and the Estate enjoyed copyright protection in the Speech and licensed it for a variery of uses, and renewed the copyright when necessary.', u'"Martin Luther King, Jr. and The March on Washington." That episode contained material filmed by CBS during the March and extensive footage of the Speech (amounting to about 60% of its total content).', u"CBS, however, did not seek the Estate's permission to use the Speech in this manner and refused to pay royalties to the Estate. The instant litigation ensued.", u'the District Court held that Dr. King\'s "performance coupled with such wide and unlimited reproduction and dissemination as occurred concomitant to Dr. King\'s speech during the March on Washington can be seen only as a general publication which thrust the speech into the public domain."', u'district court noted that there potentially was some additional eVidence of general publication', u'SCLC published a newsletter of wide circulation containing the full text of the Speech', u'an advance text of the Speech may have been freely available to the public in a press tent at the March', u'because the procedural posture of the case was one of summary judgment, and "material facts [were] in dispute as to whether the use of Dr. King\'s speech in the newsletter was authorized and also as to the actual availability of the advance text.', u'was one that communicated the contents of a work to a select group and for a limited purpose, and without the right of diffusion, reproduction, distribution or sale.', u"question is whether Dr. King's attempt to obtain statutory copyright protection on September 30, 1963 was effective, or whether it was a nullity because the Speech had already. been forfeited to the public domain via a general publication.", u'Under the regime created by the 1909 Act, an author received state common law pro- tection automatically at the time of creation of a work.', u'When a general publication. occurred, the author either forfeited his work to the public domain, or, if he had therebefore complied with federal statutoty requirements, converted his common law copyright into a federal stat- utory copyright.', u'Only a general publication divested a common law copyright.', u'general publi- cation', u'occurred "when a work was made available to members of the public at large without regard to their identity or what they intended to do with the work."', u'a non- divesting limited publication', u'the performance of a work is not a general publication.', u'a general publication occurs only in two situations.', u'general publication occurs if tangible copies of the work are .distributed to the general public in such a manner as allows the public to exercise donlinion and control over the work.', u'a general publication may occur if the work is exhibited or displayed in such a manner as to pernlit unrestricted copying by the general public.', u'distribution to the news media, as opposed to the general public, for the purpose of enabling the reporting of a contemporary newsworthy event, is only a limited publication.', u'general publication occurs only when there is "a studied effort not only to secure publicity for the contents of the addresses through the channels of information, but to <I><U>go beyond customary sources of press or broadcasting</U></I> in distributing the addresses to any interested individual."', u'This rule comports with common sense; it does not force an author whose message happens to be newsworthy to choose between obtaining news coverage for his work and preserving his common-law copyright.', u'we are unable to conclude that CBS has demonstrated beyond', u'any genuine issue of material fact that Dr. King, simply through his oral delivery of the Speech, engaged in a general publication making the Speech "available to members of the public at large without regard to their identiry or what they intended to do with the work."', u'A performance, no matter how broad the audience, is not a publication;', u'NOTES AND QUESTIONS', u'Section 101 of the 1976 Act defines publication as follows:', u'"Publication" is the distribution of copies or phonOrecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute copies or phciri.O~ records to a group Of persons for purposes\xb7 of further distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes publication.

Cangemi</I>, 188 F. Supp. 2d 398 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), the court held that a web page itself is also published when it "goes live" because at that time an Internet user can make a \xb7copy of the web page.', u'This approach is consistent with the Berne Convention, which provides that published works are those that, regardless of their mode of manufacture, are reasonably available to the public. See Berne Conv. art. 3(3).', u'Notice of Copyright', u'Before 1989, the lack of a copyright notice indicated no copyright in the work, sometimes referred to as a forfeiture or "abandonment" of copyright.', u'Today, lack of a copyright notice does not result in abandonment. Abandonment can now only occur as a result of an "intentional relinquish- ment of a known right" by the copyright owner. See, e.g., A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001).', u'Certainly, including a statement such as "I dedicate this work to the.public domain" on the work in place of a copyright notice would suffice.', u"Mere failure to enforce one's rights does not result in an abandonment, although it may support an equitable defense based on laches or estoppel. See, e.g., Kling v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 225 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir. 2000).", u'Creative Commons offers a "Public Domain Dedication" option that is clearly an express abandonment of copyright.
