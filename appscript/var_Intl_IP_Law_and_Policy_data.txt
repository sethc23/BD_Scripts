[u'OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION', u'INTRODUCTORY THEMES', u'GEORGE KOUMANTOS, REFLECTIONS ON THE CONCEPT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Intellectual Property and Information Law: Essays in Honor of Herman Cohen Jehoram 39-45 (1998)"', u'Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883)', u'Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886)', u'These were the forerunners of the "Organisation Mondiale de Ia Propriete Intellectuelle" [in English, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or \'\'WIPO"] founded in 1967 in Stockhohn.', u'The object of the rights constituting intellectual property is not the tangible support incorporating a literary or artistic work, invention or trademark, but rather the form of the work, the invention, the relationship between a symbol and a business, as such.', u'the concept of intellectual property', u'now covers the following', u'a. designs and models, which are regulated in part both by the two Conventions cited - Paris and Berne - and the domestic laws of many countries;', u'b. commercial names, mentioned in the Paris Convention as an object of industrial property and recognized as such ... by the domestic laws of several countries ...;', u'c. neighbouring rights, regulated internationally by the Rome Convention of 1961 on the protection of performing artists, producers of gramophone records and broadcasting organizations, and nationally by special provisions, often included in the laws on copyright, and often extending the protection to other categories;', u'd. plant production rights, which are the subject of an international Convention signed in Paris (in 1961 \'\'for the protection of plant production rights") and revised at Geneva (1978 and 1991), and the domestic laws of the 32 countries that ratified the Convention;', u'e. the topographies of semiconductor products, which are protected by a Treaty signed at Washington (1989, "on intellectual property regarding integrated circuits," not in force) and European Union Directive 87/54 "on the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products", which has been incorporated in the domestic law of the E U countries;', u'f. databases, when protected by a sui generis right - but this new area of intellectual property requires more detailed explanation.', u'The system adopted by the European Union for databases, [cit.] provides two types of protection for this modern form of collection, which is both a work of the mind and a product of investment: copyright protection . . . and protection by a sui generis right (provided the database involves a major investment)', u'geographical indications', u'of origin by only producers from the geographical area in question', u'it would not be possible to conceive of a subjective right of ownership to a connection between a product and a territorial area, since a right of this kind would belong to all the producers acting in the territorial area and could not be transferred, inherited etc.', u'At the heart of the rules on unfair competition is not an object to be protected but an act to be prevented.', u'the rules on unfair competition would thus give rise to a subjective right and would protect an object', u'If we accept this principle, the right over the business, created indirectly by the rules on unfair competition, should partake of the nature of intellectual property, since its object, the actual structure of the business, is of the intangible nature required.', u'[T]here are . . . differences in the legal regulation of each of the rights that constitute intellectual property. Thus the rules concerning the object and the extent of the right, as well as the extent of the protection, differ.', u'First, the object: copyright protects the form or other original aspects of personal intellectual creation in science or art; trademark law protects the connection between a word (or several words) or a picture and the business from which a product or service emanates; and patent law protects invention, i.e., a new solution to a technical problem which can be applied industrially. Here we have three different objects, the first of which is a creation of the mind, the second of commerce and the third of industry or craft.', u'The idea that monopolies are the consequence of exclusive rights that constitute intellectual property is based on the hypothesis that all the objects of these rights are unique.', u'if the right holder of the right to an object lays down exorbitant terms for a licence the user may substitute a different object - such competition breaks the monopoly.', u'Given that the needs differ in intensity, non- voluntary licences (or any other restriction of intellectual property) should be a last resort, and their acceptability and terms and conditions should be examined on a case- by-case basis. To give the same treatment to the different objects of intellectual property goes against a sense of justice.', u'all the rights it covers have an essential common feature: the intangible nature of their respective objects and the consequences of this.', u'in 1994, when the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was success- fully completed, this hugely significant trade agreement included within it the Agree- ment on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS).', u'The content and revision of these and other leading agreements, as well as the role of the World Intellectual Property Organization (which administers the Paris and Berne Conventions), the EU, and the World Trade Organization (under whose auspic<;s the TRIPS Agreement is monitored and enforced)', u'GRAEME B.

SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY', u'the laws which protect these inventions - laws which define what is to be protected and how that protection is to be effected - reflect the underlying values of a society', u'The idea that copyright, as well as other forms of exclusive privileges, was a necessary part of the good society reflects values such as liberty, property, private enterprise, accumulation of capital and rapid consumption; in a word, values that nurture capitalism', u'culture may influence what is created but it is those values, rooted in a conception of a good society, that determine how and what kind of intellectual property laws societies enact.', u'clear that one of the central motivations behind the TRIPS agreement was to target enforceability of foreign intellectual property rights in developing countries.', u'not a reflection of the need to encourage creativity or to promote the public welfare. Rather, the chief aim of the agreement is to secure from these countries and societies the full monopoly benefits that western intellectual property laws offer.', u'the difficuity in introducing western copyright principles is that these principles attempt to overturn social values which are centuries old.', u'duplication of literary work is thus, for example, not perceived as stealing but as making a good thing accessible to the general public.', u'the internationalization of intellectual property also suggests that there is some way to objectively measure protection of intellectual property.', u'The allocation of material value to goods, and the way in which this value is expressed, is grounded firmly in the history of the evolution of a people. The internationalization of intellectual property threatens to undermine, if not totally destroy, the values that indigenous systems ascribe to intellectual property and the manner in which they allocate rights to intellectual goods.', u'What the internationalization of intellectual property implies, ultimately, is that there is only one way to participate in the international economy and that is by playing in accordance with prescribed rules, regardless of its impact on a group of peoples.', u'P. JOHN KOZYRIS, COMPARATIVE LAW FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY: NEW HORIZONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES', u'first proposition', u'the utility of the comparative method is beyond dispute.', u'Comparative law not only provides alternative solutions to be used in legal reform but also gives us a better understanding of our existing law.', u'In the United States, the best evidence of our recognition of the value of comparative law is that we teach even domestic law by the comparative method.', u'We reward students not so much for right answers as for seeing as many angles as possible and for arguing in every plausible policy direction, which necessitates transcending the bound- aries of any one jurisdiction.', u'second,', u'cannot truly pursue the comparative method through the study of formal legal texts alone', u'Laws cannot be grasped in an idealized form outside the context of the society that created them.', u'Before a legal model can be transplanted, the conditions in the two societies - thfrom which it comes and the one to whlch it goes - must be taken into account.', u'Eventually, the global village created under industrialization, urbanization, and the homogenizing influence of the global mass media may reduce such need even further.', u'third', u'the here and now of comparative law is that, in the last half century or so, comparative law has exhibited remarkable stability within the United States and abroad', u'It would thus appear that comparative law is moving from eurocentric to global.', u'Yet, with the exception of the last piece, the discourse is conducted with the traditional tools of the western legal tradition', u'What has happened, I believe, and this is starkly evident in Eastern Europe, is that the western legal tradition has spread all over the developed and developing world under the rubric of modernization.', u'In the process, the western tradition has undoubtedly been enriched by other legal cultures. However, it remains dominant and, if anything, is becoming universal.', u'The real change relates to the shift of the center of gravity from private law and formal criminal law to public and regulatory law.', u'comparative work in public law is more difficuit because it requires not only technical expertise but also the ability to delve into policy issues in diverse social contexts.', u'In the comparative field, together with the Internet, Lexis and Westlaw are also doing quite a lot.', u'First,', u'they provide instant access to foreign materials in English, which are otherwise difficult, if not impossible to find, especially in updated form.', u'Second,', u'Lexis has crossed the language barrier,', u'Third,', u'the Internet not only provides access to specialized library catalogues but also enables faculty and other law professionals to communicate, form discussion groups, and share their ideas all over the world', u'As lawyers in other nations learn to use these services, they are bound to be influenced by the subtle shift in legal method from civilian deduction to common law induction.', u'Comparative law is now technologically easier, has crossed over from the private into the public domain, and is needed now more than ever because of the expansion of international transactions; the globalization of legal culture; and the movements for unification, federation, and law reform around the world', u'In the twenty-first century, the United States would be well served if it were to make a public commitment to promote the scientific study oflaw, not only for the sake of study, but also to insniate our laws from the influence of special interests and to make them more systematic, consistent, and technically expert.', u'WILLIAM L. KEEFAUVER, THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL THINKING IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW', u"Much of AT&T's globalization was driven by joint venture activity.", u'If you have ever negotiated or looked at a joint venture agreement, you know that a major component is often the intellectual property piece which usually covers patents, trademarks, copyrights, software, and technical information. Quite often, a joint venture agreement has rights flowing to and from many countries. It takes a lot of creativity to reach agreement and usually involves negotiations by lawyers and businesspeople from several countries.', u'Significantly, these negotiations are truly negotiations and are quite different from those of previous decades when a U.S. company could simply dictate the terms. All of this has not only been instructive, but also very helpful in broadening the perspectives of practitioners accustomed to thinking only of U.S. law.', u'The Values Underlying Intellectual Property Laws.', u'[T]he idea that people should be paid to be creative is a point of view that stems from the Judeo-Christian and Muslim belief in a God who created humankind in His image. It has no analogue in Hindu, Buddhist, or Confucian societies. There are real differences in beliefs about what should be freely available in the public domain and what should be for sale in the private marketplace.', u'Thinking Internationally.', u'Political commentators have noted that there are two different forms of isolationism:.one "rests partly on a fearful assessment of America\'s ability to compete in a global economy. The other derives not from ... insecurities ... but, conversely, from a supreme self-confidence that America can go it alone, that its wealth and military power make international treaties unnecessary."', u'would you expect special interests to have more or less influence in an enlarged and more multifaceted lawmaking process (involving, as we will see, foreign legislatures, international inteilectual property institutions such as the World Intellectual Property Organization, treaty negotiators, trade representatives, and dispute panels convened under the aegis of the World Trade Organization) than before the U.S. Congress', u'Civil Law Systems.', u'Scottish judge, Lord Cooper, A civilian system differs from a common law system much as rationalism differs from empiricism or deduction from induction. The civilian naturally reasons from principles to instances, the common lawyer from instances to principles. The civilian puts faith in syllogisms, the common lawyer in precedents; the first silently asking himself as each new problem arises, "What should we do this time" and the second asking aloud in the same situation, "What did we do last time?\'\' . . . The instinct of a civilian is to systematise. The working rule of the common lawyer is solvitur ambulando.', u'INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INSTITUTIONS', u'THE NATURE AND SOURCES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW', u'The term "international law" was coined by Jeremy Bentham in 1789 in his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation.', u"Bentham's international law, by contrast, refers to the rules of engagement among nation states, distinguishable from the internal law of any of those states.", u'In common parlance, the internal law of a nation state is referred to as "municipal" or "local" Jaw.', u'at least until very recently, few would have argued that intellectual property rights were determined by principles of customary international law.', u'RESTATEMENT OF THE LAW (THIRD), FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW OF THE UNITED STATES, \xa7 102"', u'(1) A rule of international law is one that has been accepted as such by the international community of states (a) in the form of customary law; (b) by international agreement; or (c) by derivation from general principles common to the major legal systems of the world. (2) Customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of states followed by them from a sense of legal obligation.', u'(3) International agreements create law for the states parties thereto and may lead to the creation of customary international law when such agreements are intended for adherence by states generally and are in fact widely accepted. (4) General principles common to the major legal systems, even if not incorporated or reflected in customary law or international agreement, may be invoked as supplementary rules of international law where appropriate.', u'"Practice of states,\'\' Subsection (2), includes diplomatic acts and instructions as well as public measures and other governmental acts and official statements of policy, whether they are unilateral or undertaken in cooperation with other states, for example in organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)', u'"Practice of states,\'\'', u'particular customary law', u'A principle of customary law is not binding on a state that declares its dissent from the principle during its development.', u'opinio juris sive necessitatis', u'A practice initially followed by states as a matter of courtesy or habit may become law when states generally come to believe that they are under a legal obligation to comply with it.', u'Conflict between international agreement and customary law.', u'Customary law and law made by international agreement have equal authoricy as international law.', u'General principles common to systems of national law may be resorted to as an independent source of law.', u'That source of law may be important when there has not been practice by states sufficient to give the particular principle status as customary law and the principle has not been legislated by general international agreement', u'Resolutions that may contribute to customary law are to be distinguished from resolutions that are legally binding on members', u'development of customary law', u'part of a "process of continuous interaction, of continuous demand and response,\'\' among decision-makers of different states. These "create expectations that effective power will be restrained and exercised in certain uniformities of pattern. . . . The reciprocal tolerances . . . create the expectations of patterns and uniformity in decision, of practice in accord with rule, commonly regarded as law.\'\'', u'a rule of customary law is not binding on any state indicating its dissent during the development of the rule (Comment d) is an accepted application of the traditional principle that international law essentially depends on the consent of states', u'instances of dissent and exemption from practice that developed into principles of general customary law have been few', u'The customary law of treaties is now codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969', u'Although the United States has not yet ratified the Vienna Convention, it takes the position that the interpretive provisions of the Convention are largely consistent with the interpretive principles of customary international law', u'Article 32 [only applies if one of 2 conditions is met (ambiguous or absurd)]', u'Is there a reason why practice may play a larger role in the identification of international, as opposed to internal national, Jaw?', u'INTERNATIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INSTRUMENTS', u'multilateral intellectual property treaties', u"did not supplant national legislation; rather, they imposed upon member countries certain obligations as to how they will treat each other's products.", u'The TRIPS Agreement is an annex to the agreement creating the World Trade Organization (WTO), which itself was an outgrowth of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.', u'In the years since the establishment of the WTO and conclusion of TRIPS, intellectual property provisions have become more prevalent in regional and bilateral "free trade agreements" (FTAs)', u'As a result, the process for developing international intellectual property standards is increasingly assuming the character of an "international regime" or set of \'\'regimes."', u'Each of the multilateral treaties is administered by one or more international intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)', u'Each organization has an administrative staff, known as the International Bureau or Secretariat, which includes professionals from a variety of different member states.', u'World Intellectual Property Organization ("WIPO")', u'Some of these treaties are administered in conjunction with other U.N. agencies, such as UNESCO', u'Convention on Biological Diversity ("CBD")', u'Food and Agriculture Organization ("FAO"),', u'World Health Organization ("WHO")', u'International Labor Organization ("ILO")', u'The TRIPS Agreement requires membership in the WTO; admission to the WTO requires agree- ment by the member states, upon satisfaction of a number of criteria relating to all of the trade issues covered by the WTO Agreement itself, not simply intellectual property.', u'Joining the WTO, for example, provides many trade benefits, such as most favored nation status, that have been viewed by many countries as outweighing any detriment from providing protection to foreign intellectual property.', u'LEADING INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS', u'The United Nations and its Specialized Agencies', u'United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)', u'WIPO', u'WIPO is an intergovernmental organization of 184 member nations with an International Bureau based in Geneva.', u'WIPO thus remains a forum (arguably still the primary forum) for the drafting, discussion, revision and conclusion of new intellectual property treaties, as well as the development of intellectual property norms through less formal lawmaking processes (such as the adoption of resolutions or recommendations or the promulgation of model laws).', u'The resolution adopted by the General Assembly contained both procedural and substantive components', u'norm setting activities shall be inclusive and member driven, take into account different levels of development, take into consideration a balance between costs and benefits, be a participatory process, which takes into consideration the interests and priorities of all WIPO Member States and the viewpoints of other stakeholders, including accredited intergovernmental organizations and non- governmental organizations, and be in line with the principle of neutrality of the WIPO Secretariat.', u'the resolution called on WIPO:', u"[t]o approach intellectual property enforcement in the context of broader societal interests and especially development-oriented concerns, with a view that ''the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the <B><I>mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare</I></B>, and to a balance of rights and obligations,'' in accordance with Article 7 of the TRIPS Agreement.", u'UNESCO', u'The principal goal of UNESCO is to contribute to peace and security in the world by promoting collaboration among nations through education, science, culture and communication.', u'The Organization also serves as administrator of the Universal Copyright Convention', u"UNESCO is served by a Secretariat based in Paris and in aimost sixty different offices scattered throughout the world;

Of late,', u'The World Health Assembly (WHA), which is the WHO\'s governing body, established the WHO Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH) in 2003 with a mandate " ... to collect data and proposals from the different actors involved and produce an analysis of intellectual property rights, innovation, and public health, including the question of appropriate funding and incentive mechanisms for the creation of new medicines and other products against diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries.\'', u'Intellectual Property in International Trade Agreements', u'The World Trade Organization', u"the TRIPS Agreement, which is an Annex to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (the WTO), brought intellectual property within the institutional infrastructure of the world's multilateral trading system.", u'it should be noted only that decisions rendered under the WTO dispute settlement system are backed by effective enforcement mechanisms; member states found to be in violation of TRIPS provisions must revise their Jaws under pain of penalties that include the imposition of trade sanctions.', u'The dispute settlement system is, however, only part of the WTO apparatus that contributes to the ongoing development of international intellectual property Jaw: another important body is the TRIPS Council.', u"THE TRIPS COUNCIL'", u'The Council for TRIPS is the body, open to all Members of the WTO, that has responsibility for the administration of the [TRIPS] Agreement, in particular monitoring the operation of the agreement.', u'One of the characteristics of the former GATT and now of the WTO is the detailed and continuous follow-up of the implementation of obligations and the monitoring of compliance with them.', u'Monitoring of compliance in the Council is done in two main ways.', u'First, the TRIPS Council is a body in which any member can raise any issue relating to compliance by other parties. This has happened on a number of occasions, either in relation to the practices of a specific country or the application of a specific provision.', u"second approach to monitoring compliance is a systematic examination of each member's national implementing legislation by the other members, involving the notification and review of the legislation of members.", u'Article 63.2 of the TRIPS Agreement requires members to notify the laws and regulations made effective by that member pertaining to the subject matter of the agreement to the TRIPS Council in order to assist the Council in its review of the operation of the agreement.', u'These notifications are the basis for reviews of implementing legislation carried out by the Council.', u'One of the benefits of the review mechanism is that it is seen as an important vehicle for resolving issues that might otherwise become the subject of formal dispute settlement proceedings.', u'The review process also provides an opportunity to identify deficiencies in notified laws and regulations, as well as differences in interpretation.', u'in addition to panel and Appellate Body reports and notified mutually agreed solutions, useful information relevant to questions of interpretation of TRIPS provisions may also be obtained from the questions raised on the floor of the TRIPS Council and the answers given by members.', u'Regional and Bilateral Trade Agreements', u'The GATT multilateral trade system, established in 1947, specifically allows for regional free-trade agreements (FTAs) and customs unions in accordance with Article XXIV(4) GATT:', u'4. The contracting parties recognize the desirability of increasing freedom of trade by the development, through voluntary agreements, of closer integration between the economies of the countries parties to such agreements. They also recogoize that the purpose of a customs union or of a free trade area should be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other contracting parties with such territories.', u'The North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993 (NAFTA), covering Canada, the United States and Mexico, was the first regional free trade agreement to include extensive provisions on intellectual property standards.', u'The TRIPS Agreement came into effect on January 1, 1995, one year after NAFTA.', u'Article 1(1) of the TRIPS Agreement provides that "Members may, but shall not be obliged to, implement in their domestic law more extensive protection than is required by this Agreement, provided that such protection does not contravene the provisions of this Agreement."', u'The European Union', u'Background to the European Union', u'the European Economic Community (and with it the collective grouping called the European Communities) was established in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome,', u'EU was only established in 1991 by the Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty).', u'The union rests on three so-called "pillars":', u'(1) the European Communities (i.e., the former European Economic Community now renamed the "European Commuuity" or "EC,\'\' the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community);', u'(2) the process of formal intergovernmental cooperation in the fields of foreign and security policy; and', u'(3) the process of formal intergovernmental cooperation in justice and home affairs (such as asylum policy, police co-operation).', u'EU legislation has also influenced the shape of national intellectual property laws outside the EU, as well as multinational intellectual property agreements.', u'This influence arises in various ways.', u'Non-EU countries that are within the European Economic Area ("EEA") -which is comprised of the EU countries plus Iceland, Norway, and Lichtenstein - must make their laws consistent with various laws of the EU including its intellectual property laws.', u'Other countries looking to join the EU are obliged to align their laws with those of the EU.', u'the EU Database Directive adopted in 1996, see infra Chapter 4, framed the discussion of proposed database protection both on the multinational level and within the United States.', u'the Term Directive, which extended the term of copyright protection within Europe to life of the author plus seventy years, is in large part what motivated the parallel Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in the United States.', u'Strictly speaking, intellectual property legislation is pursued through the legislative workings of the EC.', u'The articles of the Treaty of Rome, the foundational document of the European Communities in 1957, have undergone successive revision over the course of the last forty-two years and are now codified in. the EC Treaty.', u'The Relationship Between National and Union Law', u'One of the most important early decisions of the Court of Justice was to declare the supremacy of Community law', u'If there is a conflict between applicable Community law and a provision of national law, the national law will be subordinated to Community law.', u"the Court was seen as suspicious of broad intellectual property rights. The Court's case load tended to place it in the role of preventing the assertion of national intellectual property rights in such a way as to partition the EU market", u"The Court still considers intellectual property issues in that context,\xb7 but in the last few years, an increasingly large part of the Court's intellectual property caseload has been generated by the need to assist national courts in interpreting the various intellectual property harmonization directives as they are given effect in national law.", u'The EU Approach to Intellectual Property Norm-Setting', u'the largest part of the legislative agenda in the field of intellectual property law has been harmonization directives.', u'harmonization that has been effected by these instruments has tended to be partial or fragmentary in nature.', u'for example, the Trademark Directive harmonized registered trademark laws, but left untouched unregistered trademark or unfair competition laws.', u'early reforms of copyright law were sector-specific, targeted harmonization; the Commission only rarely included so-called "horizontal provisions," which wouid apply to all copyrighted works.', u'In the case of industrial property rights, which are largely based upon registration, the Commission has sought to go further and enact unitary Community-wide rights.', u'The first of these "unitary Community-wide laws" was created in 1994, when the EU enacted the Trademark Regulation, which created the Community Trade Mark.', u'Applications for a Community Trademark registration are determined by the OHIM, which was set up in Alicante, Spain.', u'The Status of the EU in International Intellectual Property Law', u'The EU may sign international agreements along with the individual member states.', u"The Commission has responsibility for negotiating and monitoring the Union's international trade relationships.", u'OECD', u'The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") consists of thirty member countries, largely from the developed world.', u'The OECD provides a forum for member governments to discuss economic and social policy, including issues relating to intellectual property protection and e-commerce.', u'Its role is as much to provide the opportunity for policy <liscussion as to produce formal international agreements', u'The work of the organization and its constituent governments is supported by a Secretariat based in Paris.', u'The Secretariat, which is comprised of economists, scientists, laWYers and other professional staff, produces a wide range of data and research reports for use by the governments in the formulation of economic policies', u"Member countries meet and exchange information in committees;

At the same ttme, however, the examination need not be based on the actual effects of the contested measure in the marketplace.', u'as far as the TRIPS Agreement is concerned, the relevant practical implications are those on opportunities with regard to the protection of intellectual property.', u'it is not disputed that those conditions accord less favourable treatment to persons with interests in the G Is to which those conditions apply', u'1. GI protection is not available under the Regulation in respect of geographical areas located in third countries which the Commission has not recoguized under Article 12(3).', u'European Commuuities confirms that the Commission has not recoguized any third countries.', u'GI protection under the Regulation may become available if the third country in which the GI is located enters into an international agreement or satisfies the conditions in Article 12(1).', u'Both of those requirements represent a siguificant "extra hurdle" in obtaining GI protection', u'The siguificance of the hurdie is reflected in the fact that currently no third country has entered into such an agreement or satisfied those conditions.', u'Panel finds that the equivalence and reciprocity conditions modify the effective equality of opportuuities with respect to the availability of protection to persons who wish to obtain GI protection under the Regulation, to the detriment of those who wish to obtain protection in respect of geographical areas located in third countries, including WTO Members', u'The issue for the Panel is to determine the treatment accorded to the nationals of other Members and that accorded', u"to the European Communities' own nationals, when such treatment depends on the location of Gis.", u'it also has to be recognised that there may be cases where application of formally identical legal provisions would in practice accord less favourable treatment to imported products and a contracting party might thus have to apply different legal provisions to imported products to ensure that the treatment accorded them is in fact no less favourable.', u'"[a] formal difference in treatment between imported and like domestic products is thus neither necessary, nor sufficient, to show a violation of Article III:4"', u"even if the provisions of the Regniation are formally identical in the treatment that they accord to the nationals of other Members and to the European Communities' own nationals, this is not sufficient to demonstrate that there is no violation of Article 3.1 of the TRIPS Agreement.", u'Whether or not the Regulation accords less favourable treatment to the nationals of other Members than it accords to the European Communities\' own nationals should be examined according to the "effective equality of opportunities" with regard to the protection of intellectual property rights.', u', which focuses on the "fundamental thrust and effect" of the Regniation.', u"It follows that the nationals that are relevant to an examination under Article 3.1 of the TRIPS Agreement should be those who seek opportunities with respect to the same type of intellectual property in comparable situations.  In other words, if you're not protecting american area, you're not protecting american nationals.", u"The Panel therefore considers it appropriate for the purposes of this claim to compare the effective eqnallty of opportunities for the group of nationals of other Members who may wish to seek GI protection under the Regulation and the group of the European Commnnities' own nationals who may wish to seek G I protection under the Regulation.", u'It argues that the concept of de facto discrimination should be limited to cases of circumvention of obligations, which is unnecessary in this dispute because of the applicability of the national treatment obligation nnder GATT 1994.', u'a registered GI.

The European Communities argued that it does not.', u'The Panel concluded that [Section 211 dealt with ownership of trademarks used in connection with confiscated assets and also \'\'regulated" ownership]', u'The European Communities [argues] that Article 6quinquies A(1) requires that a', u'trademark duly registered in a country of origin that is a country of the Paris Union must be accepted for registration and protected "as is" in every respect in other countries of the Paris Union, subject only to the specific exceptions set forth in that Article.', u'The United States agrees with the Panel that the obligation in Article 6quinquies A(1) to register a foreign trademark "as is" concerns only the form of the trademark.', u'Given this, the United States concludes that Section 211(a)(1) is not inconsistent with Article 6quinquies A(1) because Section 211(a)(1) does not address the form of the trademark.', u'BOLDAs the United States sees it, nothing in Article 6quinquies obliges the United States to accept the registration or renewal of a trademark if the person registering or renewing it is not the true owner of the trademark under United States law.', u'Article 6(1) states the general rule, namely, that each country of the Paris Union has the right to determine the conditions for filing and registration of trademarks in its domestic legislation.', u'in our view, the general rule under the Paris Convention (1967) is that national Jaws apply with respect to trademark registrations within the territory of each country of the Paris Union, subject to the requirements of other provisions of that Convention', u'If an applicant has duly registered a trademark in its country of origin, Article 6quinquies A(l) provides an alternative way of obtaining protection of that trademark in other countries of the Paris Union.', u"First, that trademark must be duly registered according to the domestic legislation of the country of origin, and, second, it must be registered in the applicant's country of origin, as defined in Article 6quinquies A(2).", u'an applicant from another WTO Member who seeks registration in that country of a trademark duly registered in its country of origin has the additiono.l rights that WTO Members are obliged to confer on that applicant under Article 6quinquies A(l).(', u'BOLDThe participants to this dispute disagree on the scope of the requirement imposed by Article 6quinquies A(l) to accept for filing and protect trademarks duly registered in the country of origin "as is.\'\'', u'the text of Article 6quinquies A(l), we see that the words "as is" (or, in French, "telle quelle"77) relate to the trademark to be "accepted for filing and protected" in another country based on registration in the applicant\'s country of origin.', u'The ordinary meaning of the words "as is" is "in the existing state.\'', u'The French term "telle queUe" can be defined as "sans arrangement, sans modifica- tion.\'', u"The question before us is whether the scope of the requirement (of Article 6quinquies A(l) to accept for filing and protect a trademark duly registered in the applicant's country of origin) also encompasses other features and aspects of that trademark as registered in the country of origin.", u'BOLDWe find that there is considerable contextual support for the view that the requirement to register a trademark "as is" under Article 6quinquies A(1) does not encompass all the features and aspects of that trademark.', u'Article 6(1) of the Paris Convention (1967) reserves to the countries of the Paris Union the right to detennine the conditions for filing and registration of trademarks by their domestic legislation.', u'if the requirements of Article 6quinquies A(1) lil"e interpreted as covering only the form of a trademlll"k, all the exceptions in Article 6quinquies B(1) through (3) can be given full meaning and effect.', u'we uphold the finding of the Panel ... that Section 211(a)(1) is not inconsistent with Article 2.1 of the TRIPS Agreement in conjunction with Article 6quinquies A(1) of the Paris Convention (1967).', u'The "Form" of the Trademark.', u'Are the exceptions to the <i>telle quelle</I> obligation listed in Article 6quinquiesB(1)-(3) helpful in establishing the parameters of "form" (and, hence, of the <U><B><I>telle quelle</I> obligation</B></U>)?', u'The Board in Crocker Bank explained the argument that examples of national rules relating to the form or nature of the mark include rules regarding \'\'words written in the particular alphabetic characters of the language of the country (e.g., the Slavic Cyrillic alphabet), containers for products or configurations of goods, word trademarks containing more than a certain number of letters, etc."', u'International Trademark Philosophies.', u'At its most internationalist, the original text of the clause (Article 6 of the 1883 text) could be read to require Union countries to recognize and enforce trademark rights acquired in other Union countries.', u'Because this did not reflect the intention of all the signatory states, additional, less absolute language was sought; this eventually became the phrase "telle queUe."', u'Substantive Minima in the Paris Convention: Well-Known Marks', u'We have already discussed two of these "substantive minima": Article 10bis (protection against unfair competition)

("Grupo Gigante") operates a large chain of grocery stores in Mexico, called "Gigante," meaning "Giant" in Spanish.', u'In 1963, Grupo Gigante registered the "Gigante" mark as a trade name in Mexico, and has kept its registration current ever since.', u'By 1991, Grupo Gigante had almost 100 stores in Mexico, including six in Baja, all using the mark "Gigante."', u'Two of the Baja stores were in Tijuana, a city on the U.S.- Mexican border, just south of San Diego.', u'As of August 1991, Grupo Gigante had not opened any stores in the United States.', u'That month, Michael Dallo began operating a grocery store in San Diego, using the name "Gigante Market."', u"In 1995, which was after the opening of the Dallos' first store and before the opening of their second, Grupo Gigante began exploring the possibility of expanding into Southern California.", u'It learned of the Dallos\' Gigante Market in San Diego. Grupo Gigante decided against entering the California market at that time. It did nothing about the Dallos\' store despite Grupo Gigante\'s knowledge that the Dallos were using "Gigante" in the store\'s name.', u'in June 1998, Grupo Gigante registered the "Gigante" mark with the state of California. The Dallos did likewise in July 1998. Neither has registered the mark federally.', u'in May 1999, Grupo Gigante opened its first U.S. store. That store was followed by a second later that year, and then by a third in 2000.', u'All three stores were in the Los Angeles area.', u"In July 1999, after learning of the opening of Grnpo Gigante's first U.S. store, the Dallos sent Grnpo Gigante a cease-and-desist letter, making the same demand of Grnpo Gigante that Grnpo Gigante had made of them earlier: stop using the name Gigante.", u'Grnpo Gigante responded several days later by filing this lawsuit.', u'The district court disposed of the case in a published decision on cross motions for summary judgment.', u'The court recognized that under the "territoriality principle," use of a mark in another country generally does not serve to give the user trademark rights in the United States.', u'held that because Grnpo Gigante had already made Gigante a well-known mark in Southern California by the time the Dallos began using it, an exception to the territoriality principle applied.', u'As the district court interpreted what is known as the \'\'famous-mark" or \'\'well-known mark" exception to the territoriality principle, Grnpo Gigante\'s earlier use in Mexico was sufficient to give it the superior claim to the mark in Southern California.', u'The court held, therefore, that Grnpo Gigante was entitled to a declaratory judgment that it had a valid, protectable interest in the Gigante name.', u'the court held that laches barred Grnpo Gigante from enjoining the Dallos from using the mark at their two existing stores.', u'territoriality principle', u'[p]riority of trademark rights in the United States depends solely upon priority of use in the United States, not on priority of use anywhere in the world.', u'The exception, as Grupo Gigante presents it, is that when foreign use of a mark achieves a certain level of fame for that mark within the United States, the territoriality principle no longer serves to deny priority to the earlier foreign user.', u'we have no occasion to decide, and do not decide, whether Grupo Gigante could establish protection for its mark apart from application of the famous-mark exception to the territoriality principle.', u'We hold, however, that there is a famous mark exception to the territoriality principle.', u"the district court concluded that Grupo Gigante's use of the mark had achieved secondary meaning in the San Diego area by the time the Dallos opened their first store, and thus the court held that Grupo Gigante's use was eligible for the exception to the territoriality principle.", u"We decline to go quite this far, however, because following the district court's lead would effectively cause the exception to eclipse the territoriality rule entirely.", u"Grupo Gigante would have to show that the mark has acquired secondary meaning by demonstrating that it has come to identify to consumers Grupo Gigante's particular", u"brand of store, not merely a characteristic of Grupo Gigante's stores and others like them.", u'Second, and most relevant to this case, secondary meaning defines the geographic area in which a user has priority, regardless of who uses the mark first.', u'Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine', u'priority of use in one geographic area within the United States does not necessarily suffice to establish priority in another area.', u'Thus, the first user of a mark will not necessarily be able to stop a subsequent user, where the subsequent user is in an area of the country \'\'remote" from the first user\'s area', u'To determine whether the famous-mark exception to the territoriality rule applies, the district court must determine whether the mark satisfies the secondary meaning test.', u'In addition, where the mark has not before been used in the American market, the court must be satisfied, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a substantial percentage of consumers in the relevant American market is familiar with the foreign mark.', u'In making this determination, the court should consider such factors as the intentional copying of the mark by the defendant, and whether customers of the American firm are likely to think they are patronizing the same firm that uses the mark in another country.', u'While these factors are not necessarily determinative, they are particularly relevant because they bear heavily on the risks of consumer confusion and fraud, which are the reasons for having a famous-mark exception.', u'whether the Paris Convention, implemented in \xa7 44 of the Lanham Act, creates substantive law or a right of action applicable to international trademark disputes.', u"Because the Paris Convention creates neither a federal cause of action nor additional substantive rights, the district court properly dismissed Grupo Gigante's Paris Conven- tion claims.", u'GRABER, CIRCUIT JUDGE, concurring:', u'To enjoy extraterri- torial trademark protection, the owner of a foreign trademark need not show the level of recognition necessary to receive nation-wide protection against trademark dilution.', u'On the other hand, the foreign trademark owner who does not use a mark in the United States must show more than the level of recognition that is necessary in a domestic trademark infringement case.', u'in Japan Telecom, Inc. v.

WT/DS174', u'United States claims that the Regulation is inconsistent with Article 16.1 of the TRIPS Agreement because it does not ensure that a trademark owner may prevent uses of Gis which would result in a likelihood of confusion with a prior trademark.', u'European Communities responds that this claim is unfounded for several reasons: (1) Article 14(3) of the Regulation, in fact, prevents the registration of Gis, use of which would result in a likelihood of confusion with a prior trademark; (2) Article 24.5 of the TRIPS Agreement provides for the "coexistence" of Gis and prior trademarks; (3) Article 24.3 of the TRIPS Agreement requires the European Communities to maintain "coexistence"; and (4) in any event, Article 14(2) of the Regulation would be justified as a limited exception under Article 17 of the TRIPS Agreement.', u'Article 13 of the Regulation sets out the protection conferred by registration of a GI.', u'includes a negative right to prevent misleading or unfair uses of the GI, but also a positive right to use the GI in accordance with the product specification to the exclusion of any other sigu (including trademarks)', u'Article 14(1) affirms that a registered GI prevails over a later-in-time trademark.', u'Article 14(2) creates an exception to Article 13. That exception, which is intended to implement Article 24.5 of the TRIPS Agreement, permits the continued use of a prior trademark even though use of that trademark would conflict with the exclusionary rights conferred on the GI under Article 13. Such a GI would coexist with the trademark.', u"the trademark owner's right provided by trademark legislation in the implementation of Article 16.1 of the TRIPS Agreement, in principle, cannot be exercised against a person who uses a registered GI in accordance with its registration where the trademark is subject to Article 14(2) of the Regulation", u'The United States challenges coexistence under the Regulation "as such." It relies on the fact that Article 14(2) of the Regulation, on its face, can apply to certain trademarks and, when it does, the Regulation will limit the right of the owner of such a trademark against the use of a GI.', u'[Article 14(3)] requires GI registration to be refused where it would be \'~iable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the product."', u'BOLDThis is limited to liability to mislead as to a single issue,', u'the scope of Article 14(3) is limited to a subset of trademarks which, as a minimum, excludes trademarks with no reputation, renown or use.', u'the Panel considers that the United States has made a prima facie case that Article 14(3) of the Regulation cannot prevent all situations from', u'occurring in which Article 14(2) would, in fact, limit the rights of a trademark owner', u'Article 14(3) of the Regulation has only been applied once. This was the case of "Bayerisches Bier," which was registered as a protected geographical indication in 2001 subject to the proviso that the use of certain prior trademarks, for example, BAVARIA and H0KER BAJER, was permitted to continue under Article 14(2).', u'Upon its registration, the EC Council concluded that the GI would not mislead the public as to the identity of the product, which is the standard embodied in Article 14(3) of the Regulation.', u'a court in a non-EC WTO Member found a reasonable probability that a substantial number of persons would be confused if the marks BUDEJOVICKY BUDVAR depicted in a special script, and BUDWEISER and BUD, were used together in relation to beer in a normal and fair manner and in the ordinary course of business, particularly the mark BUD.', u'However, courts in two other non-EC WTO Members found that the use of "Budijovicky Budvar" on specific beer labels did not give rise to a likelihood of confusion', u'European Communities did not deny that these Gis could be used in a manner that would result iu a likelihood of confusion with these prior trademarks .', u'Article 14(3) of the Regulation cannot prevent all situations from occurring in which a trademark would be subject to Article 14(2) and, hence, in which the Regulation would limit the rights of the owner of such a trademark', u'Panel will now proceed to examine whether the TRIPS Agreement requires Members to make available to trademark owners rights against the use of Gls.', u'involves two steps: <B>first</B>, we examine the right of trademark owners provided for in Article 16.1 of the TRIPS Agreement and <B>then</B> we continue by examining whether Article [24] provides authority to limit that right.', u'Article 16.1 of the TRIPS Agreement', u'a right which must be conferred on the owner of a registered trademark, and which may also be acquired on the basis of use', u'applies to use in the course of trade of identical or similar signs, on identical or similar goods, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion.', u'It does not specifically exclude use of signs protected as Gis.', u'text of Article 16.1 stipulates that the right for which it provides is an "exclusive" right', u', it in<licates that this right belongs to the owner of the registered trademark alone', u'there is no implied limitation vis-a-vis Gls in the text of Article 16.1 on the exclusive right which Members must make available to the owner of a registered trademark.', u"BOLDright may be exercised against a third party not having the owner's consent on the same terms, whether or not the third party nses the sign in accordance with GI protection", u"The panel declined to find any authority for limits on trademark owners' rights in Article 24 of the TRIPS Agreement, which is part of the section of the Agreement providing for protection of geographical indications", u"now consider the European Communities' argument that its particular regime of coexistence between Gls and prior trademarks is justified under Article 17 of the TRIPS Agreement.", u'European Communities defends its regime of coexistence "as such," not as applied.', u'Therefore, our consideration of this defence focuses almost entirely on the terms of the measure and its potential effects, rather than any actual effects.', u'European Communities, as the party asserting that its measure is covered by the exception in Article 17, bears the burden', u'Article 17', u'Exceptions.

Read in context, the "legitimate interests" of the trademark owner are contrasted with the \'\'rights conferred by a trademark," which also belong to the trademark owner.', u'Given that Article 17 creates an exception to the rights conferred by a trademark, the "legitimate interests" of the trademark owner must be something different from full enjoyment of those legal rights.', u'To make sense of the term "legitimate interests" in this context, that term must be defined in the way that it is often used in legal discourse - as a normative claim calling for protection of interests that are "justifiable" in the sense that they are supported by relevant public policies or other social norms.', u'Every trademark owner has a legitimate interest in preserving the distinctiveness, or capacity to distinguish, of its trademark so that it can perform that function.', u"the trademark owner's interest in the economic value of its mark arising from the reputation that it enjoys and the quality that it denotes.", u'Turning to the Regulation', u"the owner's legitimate interest in", u'preserving the distinctiveness, or capacity to distinguish, of its trademark can be taken into account in various ways. Article 7(4) of the Regulation provides that a statement of objection', u"Article 14(3) also requires the refusal of GI registration in light of a trademark's reputation and renown and the length of time it has been used, if a particular condition is fulfilled.", u'Article 14(3) of the Regulation was, in fact, applied to take account inter alia of the legitimate interest of the trademark owners to protect the distinctiveness of their respective marks.', u'Where Articles 7(4) and 14(3) of the Regulation are unavailable, and a trademark is subject to Article 14(2), there remains the possibility that its distinctiveness will be affected by the use of the GI.', u'the applicability of Article 17 given that, as a provision permitting an exception to the exclusive right to prevent uses that would result in a likelihood of confusion, it presupposes that a certain degree of likelihood of confusion can be permitted.', u'we are satisfied that where the likelihood of confusion is relatively high, the exception in Article 14(2) will not apply.', u'We also note that the proviso to Article 17', u'does not refer to "unreasonabl[e] prejudice" to those interests, unlike the provisos in Articles 13,26.2 and 30 of the TRIPS Agreement and Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention (1971) as incorporated by Article 9.1 of the TRIPS Agreement.', u'This suggests that a lesser standard of regard for the legitimate interests of the owner of the trademark is required.', u'the Panel considers that the exception created by the Regulation takes account of the legitimate interests of the owner of the trademark within the meaning of Article 17.', u'now consider whether the exception created by the Regulation takes account of the legitimate interests of third parties.', u'"third parties" for the purposes of Article 17 include consumers', u'Consum- ers have a legitimate interest in being able to distinguish the goods and services of one undertaking from those of another, and to avoid confusion.', u'European Communities submits that \'\'third parties" for the purposes of Article 17 include persons using a GI in accordance with a GI registration. The Panel agrees.', u'the Regulation not only \'\'takes account" of this legitimate interest, it also provides legally enforceable rights.', u'the Panel considers that the exception created by the Regulation takes account of the legitimate interests of third parties within the meaning of Article 17.', u"the Panel concludes that the European Communities has succeeded in raising a presumption that the exception created by the Regulation to the trademark owner's right provided for in Article 16.1 of the TRIPS Agreement is justified by Article 17 of the TRIPS Agreement. The United States has not succeeded in rebutting that presumption.", u'Therefore, the Panel concludes that, with respect to the coexistence of Gls with prior trademarks, the Regulation is inconsistent with Article 16.1 of the TRIPS Agreement but, on the basis of the evidence presented to the Panel, this is justified by Article 17 of the TRIPS Agreement.', u'ANHEUSER-BUSCH INC. v.

designate beer and were registered between 5 June 1985 and 5 August 1992.', u'The first application for registration of those marks, that for Budweiser, was filed on 24 October 1980.', u'Budvar, [established in the Czech Republic], registered its trade name in the Czechoslovakian commercial register on 1 February 1967.', u"It was registered in Czech ('Budejovicky Budvar, Narodni Podnik'), English ('Budweiser Budvar, National Corporation') and French ('Budweiser Budvar, Entreprise nationale').", u'Anheuser-Busch argued that the signs used by Budvar could be confused, within the meaning of the Finnish Trademark statute, which implemented the E U Trademark Directive, with its trade marks since those signs and trade marks', u'designate identical or similar types of goods.]', u"[The Helsinki District Court] held that the beer-bottle labels used by Budvar in Finland and, in particular, the dominant sign appearing on that label, 'Budejovicky Budvar,' especially when taken as a whole, were so different from Anheuser-Busch's trade marks and labels that the goods in question could not be confused.", u'not used as a mark but merely indicated the trade name of the brewery', u"On appeal, the Helsinki Court of Appeal ruled that there was insufficient evidence that the English version of Budvar's trade name was well known in the relevant trade circles in Finland before registration of Anheuser-Busch's trade marks, and thus set aside the judgment in so far as that court held that the English version of Budvar's trade name enjoyed protection in Finland under Article 8 of the Paris Convention.", u'The Supreme Court believed that deciding the case might require it to interpret the meaning of the TRIPS Agreement, and thus referred several questions to the European Court of Justice.', u'regarding their nature and structure, the provisions of the TRIPs Agreement do not have direct effect.', u'Those provisions are not, in principle, . . . such as to create rights upon which individuals may rely directly before the courts by virtue of Community law.', u'the relevant provisions of the national trade- mark law must be applied and interpreted, as far as possible, in the light of the wording and purpose of the relevant provisions of both [the Trademark Directive (Directive 89/ 104)] and the TRIPs Agreement.', u'whether and, if so, under what conditions a trade name may be regarded as a sign for the purposes of the first sentence of Article 16(1) of the TRIPs Agreement with the result that, under that provision, the proprietor of a trade mark has an exclusive right to prevent a third party from using that trade name without his consent', u"the exclusive right conferred by a trade mark was intended to enable the trade mark proprietor to protect his specific interests as proprietor, that is, to ensure that the trade mark can fulfil its functions and that, therefore, the exercise of that right must be reserved to cases in which a third party's use of the sign affects or is liable to affect the functions of the trade mark, in particular its essential function of guaranteeing to consumers the origin of the goods.", u"where the use of that sign allegedly made by the third party is such as to create the impression that there is a material link in trade between the third party's goods and the undertaking from which those goods originate.", u"It must be established whether the consumers targeted, including those who are confronted with the goods after they have left the third party's point of sale, are likely to interpret the sign, as it is used by the third party, as designating or tending to designate the undertaking from which the third party's goods originate", u'must establish whether that is the case in the light of the specific circumstances of the use of the sign allegedly made by the third party in the main case, namely, in the present case, the labelling used by Budvar in Finland.', u"must also confirm whether the use made in the present case is one 'in the course of trade' and 'in relation to goods' within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Directive 89/104.", u"the purpose of the TRIPs Agreement is to 'reduce distortions and impediments to international trade' by 'taking into account the need to promote effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights' while at the same time ensuring that 'measures and procedures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves become barriers to legitimate trade.'", u'The relevant provisions of national trade-mark law must therefore be applied and interpreted to the effect that the exercise of the exclusive right', u'general purpose of the TRIPs Agreement', u'is to ensure that a balance is maintained between the aim of reducing distortions and impediments to international trade and that of promoting effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights so as to ensure that the measures and procedures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves become barriers to legitimate trade.', u"the conditions laid down in Article 16 of the TRIPs Agreement, in the authentic French, English and

THE PAN-AMERICAN CoNVENTION, TRIPS, AND THE FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS ("FTAA")', u'The purpose of this article is to review the trademark provisions of the Pan- American Convention and TRIPS in order to ascertain whether they are compatible and whether in some respects the Pan-American Convention might serve as a suitable model for the trademark provisions under the current FTAA initiative to achieve harmonization of trademark law through the Americas.', u'BOLDIII. A COMPARISON OF THE TRADEMARK PROVISIONS OF THE PAN-AMERICAN CONVENTION AND TRIPS', u'<U>A. Minimum Standards</U>\nTRIPS provides that "Members may, but shall not be obligated to, implement in their law more extensive protection than is required by this Agreement, provided that such protection does not contravene the provisions of this Agreement." [art. 1(1)]. Thus, the compatibility of the Pan-American Convention with TRIPS will depend on,whether the Pan-American Convention (1) meets at least the minimum standards and (2) does not otherwise contravene TRIPS.', u'<U>B. National Treatment </U>\n[In Article 1, the Pan-American Convention requires Contracting States to grant national treatment to nationals of other Contracting States with respect to trademarks, trade names, and the repression of unfair competition and false indications of geographical origin or source.]', u'<U>C. Protectible Subject Matter </U>\n...The Pan-American Convention does not expressly define trademarks subject to its protection. Under the Pan-American Convention, marks lacking any distinctive character or otherwise generic are not registrable. In determining distinctiveness, "a significance distinctive of the applicant\'s goods" acquired through use is to be taken into account. Thus, the subject matter protectible as a mark under the Pan-American Convention appears to contemplate signs "capable of distinguishing" goods or services, and, as permitted by TRIPS, the Pan-American Convention recognizes distinctiveness acquired through use. . . . \n\nThe Pan-American Convention generally follows the Paris Convention (and, hence, TRIPS (Article 15(2)) in stating that registration "may be refused" of marks which (1) infringe the rights of third-parties in the nation where registration is claimed, (2) are devoid of distinctive character, and (3) offend public morals. Both Conventions provide for refusal of registration of marks containing, without authorization, various national symbols. In addition, the Pan-American Convention provides for the denial of registration to marks which (1) expose persons or institutions to ridicule or contempt, (2) contain "racial types" or scenes typical or characteristic of any of the Contracting States, other than that of the origin of the mark, or (3) have as a principal distinguishing element the trade name of a person engaged in any of the Contracting States in the manufacture, or trade of goods in the same class. These additional grounds for refusal would not appear to derogate from the provisions of the Paris Convention and, therefore, do not conflict with TRIPS Article 15(2).', u'<U>D. Registration </U>\n. . . The Pan-American Convention provides that a person can apply for protection of its mark either "directly to the proper office of the State in which he desires to obtain protection, or through the Inter-American Trade Mark Bureau referred to in the Protocol. . . . " Further, marks "registered or legally protected in one of the Contracting States shall be admitted to registration" in the other Contracting States, provided they comply with the domestic law of such states. Thus, under the Pan- American Convention, registration may be obtained in a Contracting State without the need for a supporting registration in the country of origin, and whether or not use is required to apply for or maintain a registration wouid be a matter of the domestic law of each State. The principle of territoriality is recognized at Article 10, which provides that each registration shall exist independently of registrations in any other Contracting State. The Pan-American Convention contains no mandate that use not be a requirement for filing an application, nor does it specify a period of time after which a mark may be canceled for nonuse, and, therefore, in these respects does not meet the minimum standards of TRIPS.', u'<U>E. Term of Protection</U> \nThe Pan-American Convention provides that the period of protection "shall be the period fixed by the laws of the State in which registration, deposit or renewal is made at the time when made." As a resuit, the period of protection would have to be raised to a uniform term of not less than seven (7) years to be compatible with Article 18 of TRIPS, and ten (10) years to comply with Article 1708, Section 7, of the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA").', u'<U>F. Enforceability of Registrations</U> \n1. Opposition \n\nThe Pan-American Convention sets forth in some detail a trademark owner\'s right to oppose or seek the cancellation of a mark Article 7, "Opposition," provides as follows: Any owner of a mark protected in one of the Contracting States in accordance with its domestic law, who may know that some other person is using or applying to register or deposit an interfering mark in any other of the Contracting States, shall have the right to oppose such use, registration or deposit and shall have the right to employ all legal means, procedure or recourse provided in the country in which such interfering mark is being used or where its registration or deposit is being sought, and upon proof that the person who is using such mark or applying to register or deposit it, had knowledge of the existence and continuous use in any of the Contracting States of the mark on which opposition is based upon goods of the same class, the opposer may claim for himself the preferentiai right to use such mark in the country where the opposition is made or priority to register or deposit it in such country, upon compliance with the requirements established by the domestic legislation in such country and by this Convention. \n\nWhile Article 7 does not specify precisely what legal means, procedure or recourse a Contracting State must provide an opposer, the opposition rights conferred upon a trademark owner are noteworthy: (1) the right to oppose is granted to the owner of a mark \'\'protected," not necessarily registered, in a Contracting State; (2) the right to oppose covers not only registration but also use by the offending party; (3) the trademark owner need not be registered or using its mark in the Contracting State where it is opposing the interfering mark; (4) the opposer succeeds to the rights of the user of the interfering mark upon proof that the person \'\'had knowledge of the existence', u'and continuous use in any of the Contracting States" of opposer\'s mark on the same class of goods; but, (5) the right to oppose does not appear to depend upon proof of such knowledge. \n\nArguably, this right of opposition encompasses the protection given well-known, or "famous," marks at Article 6bis of the Paris Convention, and incorporated at Article 16(2),(3) of TRIPS. TRIPS extends Articles 6bis protection to goods not similar to those on which the famous mark is registered. The Pan-American Convention may be similarly construed. Article 7 does not limit the trademark owner\'s right to oppose to marks being used on the same class of goods, but provides that where such is the case, the opposer may succeed to the infringer\'s preferential rights.', u'2. Cancellation \n\nArticle 8 of the Pan-American Convention provides for cancellation of an "interfering mark" as follows: \n\nWhen the owner of a mark seeks the registration or deposit of the mark in a Contracting State other than that of origin of the mark and such registration or deposit is refused because of the previous registration or deposit of an interfering mark, he shall have the right to apply for and obtain the cancellation or annuhnent of the interfering mark upon proving, in accordance with the legal procedure of the country in which cancellation is sought, the stipulations in Paragraph (a) and those of either Paragraph (b) or (c) below: \n\n(a) That he enjoyed legal protection for his mark in another of the Contracting States prior to the date of the application for the registration or deposit which he seeks to cancel; and \n\n(b) that the claimant of the interfering mark, the cancellation of which is sought, had knowledge of the use, employment, registration or deposit in any of the Contracting States of the mark for the specific goods to which said interfering mark is applied, prior to adoption and use thereof or prior to the filing of the application or deposit of the mark which is sought to be canceled; or \n\n(c) that the owner of the mark who seeks cancellation based on a prior right to the ownership and use of such mark, has traded or trades with or in the country in which cancellation is sought, and that goods designated by his mark have circulated and circulate in said country from a date prior to the filing of the application for registration or deposit for the mark, the cancellation which is claimed, or prior to the adoption and use of the same. \n\nArticle 8 thus provides alternative grounds for cancellation. Article 8(b) considers the nature of use of the interfering mark in conjunction with the interfering party\'s prior knowledge of the owner\'s rights, whether or not the owner\'s mark has actually been used in the country where cancellation is sought. Article 8(c), on the other hand, contemplates cancellation where the owner\'s mark has been used in the country where cancellation is sought. Sigulficantly, Article 8(c) does not requlre that such use be on the specific goods on which the interfering mark is used. \n\nThe Pan-American Convention refers to opposition or cancellation of "interfering marks." Presumably, these may be either identical or similar marks.27 The Pan- American Convention does not expressly apply a likelihood of confusion standard or a presumption of likelihood of confusion, as does TRIPS at Article 16(1). It does, however, provide that the opposer or party seeking cancellation may use "all legal means" provided in the country where cancellation is sought. \n\nThe international protection provided under Articles 7 and 8 of the Pan-American Convention arguably goes beyond TRIPS and Article 6bis of the Paris Convention.', u'While the Pan-American Convention opposition and cancellation procedures would encompass "famous" marks, it is not limited to such marks. In both Articles 7 and 8 it is not the public\'s knowledge of the mark, but, rather, the infringer\'s knowledge of the owner\'s mark (or, alternatively, prior trade in goods under the owner\'s mark)28 that is significant, though not absolutely necessary, for enforcement of the trademark owner\'s rights. It may be that these provisions of the Pan-American Convention would, if properly implemented, provide a higher level of protection against infringement than the rights conferred under TRIPS.', u"<U>G. Unauthorized Use By Agent</U> \nThe Pan-American Convention gives the owner of a mark the right to demand cancellation of a registration by his agent in another Contracting State and to succeed to protection for himself as of the date of the agent's application.", u'<U>H. Transfer of Marks</U> \n"The transfer of the ownership of a registered or deposited mark in the country of its original registration shall be effective and shall be recognized in the other Contracting States. . . . " Transfers are recognized so long as they are executed and registered in accordance with the law of the country in which the transfer took place. TRIPS, in contrast, provides that the owner of a registered mark "shall have the right to assign the trade mark with or without the transfer of the business to which the trade mark belongs." Thus, there may be a conflict between the TRIPS mandate and the Pan-American Convention were any of its Contracting States not to permit assignment without the transfer of the relevant business.', u'<U>IV. CONCLUSION <U>\nUnder the Pan-American Convention, certain issues including (1) the basis for filing an application, (2) the term of registration, (3) the minimal period of nonuse which allows cancellation, and (4) the transfer of marks with or without the relevant business, are left to the domestic laws of the Contracting States, and may not meet minimum TRIPS standards. Significantly, however, there are a number of points where the Pan-American Convention appears to meet and perhaps, with regard to enforcement, even exceed minimum TRIPS standards. These include (1) national treatment, (2) protectible subject matter, (3) enforceability of registrations and of marks "protected" in any Contracting State, with or without use in the country in which protection is sought, and (4) unauthorized use by agents. One of the more intriguing questions is whether the accompanying and long since defunct Protocol, which provided for a type of centralized registration among the Americas, might be worth reviewing, keeping in mind that the Pan-American Conven- tion was never very popular among the nations within the Americas. For example, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico failed to ratify it. Perhaps the next step, then, is to examine the Pan-American Convention in light of NAFTA to determine whether certain of its features, or its Protocol, might offer any insights into the process and require- ments of hemispheric harmonization.', u'HAVANA CLUB HOLDING, S.A. v. GALLEON S.A. 203 F.3d 116 (2d Cir. 2000)', u'Havana Club Holding, S.A. ("HCH") and Havana Club International, S.A. ("HCI") appeal from the June 28, 1999, judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Shira A. Scheindlin, District Judge), dismissing trademark, trade name, and false advertising claims against Defendants-Appellees Bacardi & Company Ltd. and Bacardi-Martini USA, Inc.', u'We conclude that the Cuban embargo barred assignment to HCH of the "Havana Club" trademark registered in the United States, that we are precluded by statute from enforcing whatever rights HCI might have to trade name protection under the General Inter-American Convention for Trade Mark and Commercial Protection, and that HCI Jacks standing to assert its false advertising and unfair competition claims under the Lanham Act.', u'We therefore affirm.', u'Plaintiff-Appellant HCI is a joint stock company organized under the Jaws of Cuba, with its domicile and principal place of business in Cuba', u', a Luxembourg corporation, owns the "Havana Club" trademark in certain countries outside the United States.', u'Defendant-Appellee Bacardi & Company is a corporation organized in Liechtenstein and headquartered in the Bahamas, and Defendant- Appellee Bacardi-Martini USA is a Delaware corporation (collectively "Bacardi"). Defendant Galleon S.A. has merged into Bacardi & Company.', u'Before the Cuban revolution, Jose Arechabala, S.A. ("JASA"), a Cuban corporation owned principally by members of the Arechabala family, produced "Havana Club" rum and owned the trademark "Havana Club" for use with its rum. JASA exported its rum to the United States until 1960, when the Cuban government, under the leadership of Fidel Castro, seized and expropriated JASA\'s assets. Neither JASA nor its owners ever received compensation for the seized assets from the Cuban government.', u'The Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to administer the Cuban embargo, which he has delegated to the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC")', u'From 1972 to 1993, Empresa Cubana Exportadora De Alimentos y Productos Varios ("Cubaexport"), a Cuban state enterprise, exclusively exported "Havana Club" rum, primarily to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Cubaexport registered the "Havana Club" trademark with [the) Cuban authorities in 1974 under Registration No. 110,353, and with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO\'\') in 1976 under Registration No. 1,031,651.', u'In 1993, Cubaexport sought to reorganize and find a foreign partner for its "Havana Club" rum business. Havana Rum & Liquors, S.A. ("HR & L"), a newly formed Cuban company, entered into a joint venture agreement with Pernod Ricard, S.A. ("Pernod"), a French company distributing liquor internationally.', u'In an agreement dated January 10, 1994, Cubaexport assigned trademark Registration No. 1,031,651, the United States registration for the "Havana Club" trademark, to H R & L, and in a', u'subsequent agreement dated June 22, 1994, HR & L assigned this trademark to HCH.', u'In 1996, HCH renewed the United States registration of the "Havana Club" mark for a term of ten years.', u'In April1997, Bacardi & Co. purchased the Arechabala family\'s rights (if any) to the "Havana Club" trademark, the related goodwill of the business, and any rum business assets still owned by the Arechabala family.', u'After an October 5, 1995, application to OFAC for a "specific" license authorizing the 1994 assignments of the "Havana Club" trademark from Cubaexport to HR & L, and from HR & L to HCH,\' OFAC, on November 13, 1995, issued to Cubaexport License No. C-18147, which approved the two assignments and authorized all necessary transactions incident to the assignments of the mark.', u'However, on April17, 1997, after the instant lawsuit was filed in the District Court, OFAC issued a Notice of Revocation, [retroactively] revoking License No. C-18147 [on the basis of "facts and circumstances that have come to the attention of this Office which were not included in the application of October 5, 1995" and declaring any actions taken pursuant to the license were "nuil and void as to matters under the jurisdiction of the Office of Foreign Assets Control."', u'Since 1994, HCI has exported rum under the "Havana Club" trademark under an exclusive license to that mark from HCH.', u'Because of the Cuban embargo, however, HCI\'s "Havana Club" rum has never been sold in the United States.', u'Beginning in 1995, Bacardi-Martiui\'s predecessor-in-interest, Galleon S.A., produced rum in the Bahamas bearing the "Havana Club" name, and distributed sixteen cases of this rum in the United States. From May 1996 to August 1996, Bacardi distributed an additional 906 cases of "Havana Club" rum in the United States.', u'In December 1996, HCH and HCI filed the instant action to enjoin Bacardi from using the "Havana Club" trademark, alleging violations of sections 32 and 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 ("Lanham Act")', u"Among Bacardi's defenses was a claim that OFAC's specific license to HCH, authorizing the assignments of the U.S. trademark, was invalid because HCH obtained the mark by fraud", u'In August 1997, the District Court ruied that HCH had no rights to the "Havana Club" trademark because the specific license to assign the mark to HCH had been nullified', u'During the bench trial, the District Court ruled that H CH, a Luxembourg corporation, could not claim rights to trade name protection under the IAC because Luxembourg was not a party to the IAC.', u"The District Court held that HCI had no standing to pursue this claim [of falsely designating origin], because the Cuban embargo prevented H CI from selling its rum in the United States, and thereby from suffering commercial injury because of Bacardi's actions.", u'HCH recognizes that to have enforceable rights in the United States, it must find authority for the assignment somewhere in United States law, because in the absence of such authority, the Cuban embargo renders null and void the transfer of trademark registrations in which a Cuban national or entity has an interest', u'As authority for the assignments, HCH\'s Complaint in this litigation initially invoked the "specific" license issued by OFAC in November 1995, which "licensed" the assignments. However, after OF AC revoked the specific license in 1997, HCH has relied on the "general" licensing authority in 31 C.F.R. \xa7 515.527.', u'(a) Whether the CACR prohibit the assignments.', u'only Cubaexport, the original registrant of the United States registration for the "Havana Club" trademark, has the authority to renew the "Havana Club" trademark, and a specific license is required in order to assign it.', u'Article 11 of the lAC.', u'HCH contends that failure to recognize its rights as assignee of the United States registration for the "Havana Club" trademark would nullify rights guaranteed by Article 11 of the lAC.', u'Article 11', u'The transfer of the ownership of a registered or deposited mark in the country of its original registration shall be effective and shall be recognized in the other Contracting States, provided that reliable proof be furnished that such transfer has been executed and registered in accordance with the internal law of the State in which such transfer took place. Such transfer shall be recorded in accordance with the legislation of the country in which it is to be effective.', u'A "treaty will not be deemed to have been abrogated or modified by a later statute unless such purpose on the part of Congress has been clearly expressed."', u'Although neither the CACR nor the LIBERT AD Act refers expressly to the lAC, the question of abrogation does not turn on whether the lAC has been expressly identified for abrogation.', u'What is required is a clear expression by Congress of a purpose to override protection that a treaty would otherwise provide.', u'We must therefore accord primacy to the prohibition of the CACR that bars a Cuban national or entity from transferring a United States trademark.', u'HCH has no enforceable rights to the "Havana Club" trademark.', u'HCI contends that Bacardi infringed its rights under the lAC to protection of the "Havana Club" trade name.', u'The lAC provides that any manufacturer "domiciled or established" in a signatory country that uses a particular trade name or commercial name may enjoin the use of that name in another signatory country that is \'\'identical with or deceptively similar to" its trade name. lAC art. 18, 46 Stat. at 2928-30.', u'Rights to trade names and commercial names arising under treaties may be asserted under section 44(b) of the Lanham Act .... Section 44(g) of the Lanham Act adds, "Trade names or commercial names of persons described in subsection (b) of this section shall be protected without the obligation of filing or registration whether or not they form parts of marks.', u'section 211 of the Omnibus Act', u'(b) No U.S. court shall recognize, enforce or otherwise validate any assertion of treaty rights by a designated national or its successor-in-interest under sections 44(b) or (e) of the Trademark Act of 1946 for a mark, trade name, or commercial name that is the same as or substantially similar to a mark, trade name, or commercial name that was used in connection with a business or assets that were confiscated unless the original owner of such mark, trade name, or commercial name, or the bona fide successor-in-interest has expressly con- sented. (c) The Secretary of the Treasury shall promulgate such rules and regula- tions as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. (d) [the statute defined "designated national" and "confiscated" by reference to terms used elsewhere in the CFR.]', u'HCI is a "designated national" under section 211(b) because HCI is organized under the laws of Cuba, is domiciled in Cuba, and has its principal place of business in Cuba.', u"Applying section 211(b), the District Court ruled that it precluded HCI's assertion of treaty rights under sections 44(b) or (e) of the Lanham Act and thereby precluded H Cl's claims under the lAC.", u'When enacted in 1946, section 44(b) of the Lanham Act specifically incorporated the treaty rights of: [p ]ersons who are nationals of, domiciled in, or have a bona fide and effective business or commercial establishment in any foreign country, which is a party to (1) the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Proper- ty ... or (2) the General Inter-American Convention for Trade Mark and Commercial Protection . . . or (3) any other convention or treaty relating to trade-marks, trade or commercial names, or the repression of unfair competi- tion to which the United States is a party ....', u'the Supreme Court had already ruled the lAC to be self-executing', u'Congress intended the Lanham Act "[t]o carry out by statute our international commitments to the end that American traders in foreign countries may secure the protection to their marks to which they are entitled."', u'IMPORTANTTherefore, HCI must assert its rights under the lAC pursuant to section 44(b) of the Lanham Act.', u'standing under section 43(a)', u'plaintiff must demonstrate a "reasonable interest to be protected" against the advertiser\'s false or misleading claims, and a "reasonable basis" for believing that this interest is likely to be damaged by the false or misleading advertising. The "reasonable basis" prong embodies a requirement that the plaintiff show both. likely injury and a causal nexus to the false advertising.', u'"Although a section 43 plaintiff need not be a direct competitor, it is apparent that, at a minimum, standing to bring a section 43 claim requires the potential for a commercial or competitive injury."', u'Even if HCI competes with Bacardi in markets elsewhere in the world, standing requires that HCI demon- strate at least potential commercial injury in the United States, because Bacardi sells "Havana Club" rum only in the United States.', u'Article 2l(c) of the lAC defines an act of "unfair competition" to include "[t]he use of false indications of geographical origin or source of goods, by words, symbols, or other means which tend in that respect to deceive the public in the country in which these acts occur." 46 Stat. at 2932.', u'We note, however, that article 21 of the lAC authorizes the prohibition of its specified acts of unfair competition \'\'unless otherwise effectively dealt with under the domestic laws of the Contracting States."', u'GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS', u'the term "geographical indication" encompasses both \'\'indications of source" and "appellations of origin."', u'"Indications of source" is commonly understood to mean a word or other symbol that indicates that a product originates in a specific geographic region.', u'"Appellation of Origin" refers to a word or symbol that indicates both that the product originates from a specific geographic region and that it possesses the qualities or characteristics for which that place is known.', u'For example, the designation ROQUEFORT for cheese would be an appellation of origin because its use suggests certain qualities associated with cheese from this French municipality; in contrast use of that same geographic designation for clothing from Roquefort would merely be an indication of source because Roquefort is not particularly well-known for producing clothing of any particular, distinctive quality.', u'Current International Agreements in General', u'ALBRECHT CONRAD, THE PROTECTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS IN THE TRIPS AGREEMENT 86 TRADEMARK REP. 11 (1996)"', u'geographical indications dates back to the conclusion of the Paris Convention . . . in 1883, which included as protectible subject matter "indications of source or appellations of origin," Article 1(2)', u'Article 10 prohibited the use of false geographical indications only if they were accompanied by a false, fictitious, or deceptive trade name.', u'With the scope of protection so narrowly defined, the provision lacked effectiveness, and soon a number of countries undertook to establish a new uulon for the protection of geographical indications: The Madrid Agreement [for the Prevention of False or Misleading Indications of Source on Goods] of 1891 ("Madrid Agreement").', u'In 1958, the Revision Conference for the Paris Convention of Lisbon adopted a few changes regarding geographical indications, including the cancellation of the above- mentioned restriction of the scope of protection.', u'a new attempt to foster protection of geographical indications: the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration ("Lisbon Agreement").', u'three main conventions result in three concentric groups of states:', u'(1) A small number of members of the Lisbon Agreement (17 members) with an international registration of geographic origins and strict protection.', u'(2) A larger number of member states of the Madrid Agreement (31 members), bound mainly to implement border measures and to prevent the dilution of geographical indications into generic terms.', u'(3) The large number of member states of the Paris Convention (117 members), agreeing mainly to border measures for false indications without defining the conditions for protection.', u'The protection of geographical indications under the Paris Convention is very limited. Indications of Source and Appellations of Origin are included among the objects of its protection, Article 1.', u'The provision concerning geographical indications alone, Article 10, as revised at the Revision Conference of Lisbon (1958), refers back to Article 9 and mainly provides for border measures against the importation of goods bearing false representations of origin, but only if such measures are available under the law of the member country.', u'The agreement does not, however, define \'\'indication of origin," nor does it state when a representation is false. The protection is left to the member countries.', u'Article 10bis(3) of the Convention, regarding unfair competition, prohibits indications as to the "characteristics" of the goods, if they are liable to mislead the public. This might suggest that in cases where a geographical name is understood in commerce not only as an indication of origin but also as a description of the product\'s quality or "characteristics," the indication is protected under Article !Obis.', u'the Paris Convention prevents only the importation of goods containing false geographical indications but it is not applicable to indications that are merely misleading', u'The Madrid Agreement exceeds the Paris Convention on three points.', u'First, [Art. 1(1)] extends the protection to misleading geographical indications [by requiring signatory states to seize "goods bearing a false or misleading indication" of origin in a signatory country]', u'Second, Article 3bis, which was adopted by the Revision Conference of London (1934), prohibits the use of false representations on the product itself and in advertising or other forms of public announcements.', u'Third, and most important is Article 4, which prohibits member countries from treating geographical indications of wines as generic terms.', u'The Lisbon Agreement was an attempt to secure effective and enforceable protection of geographical indications on a new basis', u', and also includes adoption of a registration system comparable to that of trademarks,', u'The object of the Lisbon Agreement concerns appellations of origin, as defined in Article 2(1).', u'the French interpretation of "appellations d\' origine" by restricting the indications protected to cases in which the quality and characteristics are "exclusively or essentially due to the geographical environment, including natural and human factors."', u'main feature of the agreement is that these appellations of origin are \'\'recognized and protected as such (ace titre) in the country of origin and registered at the International Bureau of Intellectual Property," an agency of WIPO.', u'Once registered, a geographic indication is protected in other member countries "in accor- dance with this agreement" (Article 1). The countries have to ensure that any kind of usurpation or imitation is prohibited under their laws, including the use of terms like "type" or "style" along with the indication (Article 3); no geographical indication can be deemed generic in any other country as long as it is protected in its country of origin (Article 6).', u'Two critical points have prevented important nations from joining the Lisbon Agreement', u'First, international protection is granted only if the geographical indication is protected in the country of origin "as such"; hence, the concept of protection through the law of unfair competition or the law of advertising is not recognized.', u'Second, the Agreement does not make exceptions for terms that have already become generic in some member countries.77 The issue of genericness is one of the difficult problems on the international level which has hindered the negotiating process of TRIPS.', u'After the failure of the Lisbon Agreement,', u'Lists of protected geographical names accompany the agreements, and the producers from each of these regions retain exclusive right to use the name. The scope of protection is then determined under the law of the country of origin. As a result, the country of origin controls the requirements for the legitimate use of certain geographical indications at home and abroad.', u'Rnles of one country are "exported" together with its goods into another country.', u'some problems have emerged', u'In each case of alleged violation, the court must apply the law of the country of origin instead of its own laws (which wonld be applicable under the Conflict of Laws rules of most countries).', u"' Thus, the objection of the United States to the Lisbon Agreement, i.e., that American courts wonld be bound by the decisions of a foreign jurisdiction, wonld apply to these agreements as well.", u'Finally, the countries which practice protection through the consumer-oriented approach of unfair competition are again at a disadvantage because it is very unlikely that a court in the forum state wonld conduct a survey of the perception of consumers in the country of origin of the product.', u'The TRIPS Agreement includes a definition of the term "geographical indications," [namely an indication that identifies goods that originate from a particular place in a Member State \'\'where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good <U>is essentially attributable</U> to its geographical origin."].', u'Article 22(1) is derived from Article 2 of the Lisbon Agreement which reads: In this Agreement "appellation of origin" means the geographical name of a country, region or locality, which serves to designate a product originating therein, the quality and characteristics of which are <B>due exclusively or essentially to</B> the geographical environment, including natural and human factors.', u'In the Lisbon Agreement, the lack of a standard is not as critical because protection is granted only to indications that are protected "as such" in their countries of origin and registered at the "International Bureau."', u'IMPORTANTFactors that have been considered in determining whether certain qualities are "attributable" to the geographical area include soil, climate, fauna, and flora.', u'When the definition was introduced through Article 19 of the EC Draft of 1990, it still contained an equivalent to the last part of the Lisbon definition: "including natural and human factors."', u'the definition was [later] omitted and the point apparently was not discussed extensively.', u'the omission may be. siguificant. In view of the Lisbon and the WIPO Model Law, Ariicle 22(1) could be construed to exclude human factors.', u'For the protection of Sheffield Silver or Meissen Porcelain, for example, the origin of the raw materials in the area remains the ouly factor relevant to determine its protectability, not the tradition and craftsmanship that was handed down over generations.', u'The scope of goods that can be protected by geographical indications is narrowed almost exclusively to agricultural products; manufacturers are not protected even if their product is "essentially" linked to the cultural heritage of the region.', u'IMPORTANTonly "goods" are included.', u'Ariicle 22(2) contains the basic concept for the substantive standards that the TRIPS Agreement was trying to accomplish throughout its member states. [It requires, in respect of geographical indications, the provision of legal means for \'\'interested parties to prevent: (a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a geographical area other than the true place of origin in a manner which misleads the public as to the geographical origin of the good; and (b) any use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of Article !Obis of the Paris Convention"', u'The wording of Ariicle 22(2)(a) is relatively broad and leaves ample space for different countries to apply their national concepts in order to comply with the provision.', u'According to Article 22(2)(a), two requirements must be fulfilled in order to allege a violation. A representation on a certain good must suggest its origin (be geographically descriptive); and this suggestion must be false or misleading.', u'The wording of Article 22(2) is unclear as to whether or not it includes such indications [in the "form of presentation"] .... [T]he wording "any means in the designation or presentation" suggests that any mark, sign, or design shall be included, as long as a goods-place-association can be shown.', u'Hence, symbols representing a landmark or geographic location are prohibited, if they give rise to an erroneous association with a place.', u'Article 22(4) also prevents a true statement which is nevertheless misleading as to the origin of the goods from undermining the effectiveness of the provision.', u'Accordingly, renaming the Napa Valley Champagne, Burgundy or Chablis would be of no avail to California wine-growers - a soothing prospect for the French producers.', u'Article 22(2)(b) protects the interests of producers and merchants, whereas Article 22(2)(a) is aimed at representations misleading the public, i.e., consumers, Article 22(2)(b)', u'In the United States, under the regulations of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), the general rule is that a name', u'of geographic significance may be used only to designate wines of the origin indicated by such name, unless the names have been found to be generic or semi-generic. [See 27 C.F.R \xa7 4.24(c)(1) (1993)]', u'Only two names have been found to be generic, Vermouth and Sake. [!d. \xa7 4.24(h)(2)].', u'Sixteen names, however, are deemed to be semi-generic, including Chianti, Burgundy, Champagne and Chablis. According to the regulations, they can be used as long as the real origin is used in direct conjunction with the name.', u'to prevent geographical indications from becoming generic terms,', u'one technique is to prohibit strategies which on their face prevent deception of the public by adding "style" or "type" to the geographical name or indicating the the place of origin, but which nevertheless dilute the perception of the name.', u'This approach has been accepted under Article 23(1), [which requires member states to provide means for interested parties to prevent use of a geographical indication identifying wines or spirits for those products not originating in the place identified, even when the trne origin is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation or accompanied by expressions such as "style" etc.]', u'For wines, Article 23(1) precludes the defense that the presentation of the goods is not deceptive or misleading.', u'Another possible technique which has also been incorporated into the Agreement (Article 23(2)) relates to the law of trademarks: it prohibits registration when a trademark is primarily geographically descriptive.', u'important exceptions can be found in Article 24(6).', u'The first part of (6) suspends the application of Articles 22-24 in a member state (Forum 2), if a geographical name of Forum 1 is a generic term in Forum 2.', u'The second part specifically addresses the problem that wines are often named after the grapes used in them and that these names are often indirect indications of origin (e.g., "Riesling" for German or Alsatian wine). In that case, as long as the grape "existed" at the date of entry into force of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the use of its name is allowed.', u'Articles 23(1) and (2) will not permit more geographical names to lose their geographical connotation and will therefore provide an effective standard for the future.', u'TRIPS, for the first time implementing substantive standards of protection, now includes a resolution of the issue: the registrability of geographical names as trademarks in general (Article 22(3)), and of wines in particular (Article 23(2)). A grandfather clause is added in Article 24(5).', u'The TRIPS Agreement is a compromise between the two concepts: it generally adopts a view similar to the United States concept by making eligibility for registration as a trademark subject to the perception of the public (Article 22(3))', u'Article 24(5) adds two exceptions to the [provisions on the] registrability of trademarks.', u'Section (a) states that a mark that was registered in good faith before the TRIPS Agreement will continue to be a valid trademark.', u'Commonly, the term "in good faith" is construed to mean that the party did not (and was not required to) know of the rights of other parties. If "good faith" is construed to mean \'\'not knowing of the existence of the other party," the scope of the exception is considerably smaller, because a geographical name is rarely used without knowledge of its origin.', u'Article 24(6) which allows the use of geographical indications if they have become generic terms', u'Accordingly, the members of TRIPS must be able to make regulations concerning the use of such generic terms which can include their eligibility for registration as a trademark.', u'The most adequate solution would be to interpret "in good faith" as meaning \'\'without deceptive or misleading intent," thus excluding the protec tion of past deceptions while', u'acknowledging legitimate uses of a name over considerable time.', u'The second exception, section (b), seems slightly more problematic under policy considerations: a trademark consisting of a geographical indication is valid as long as it was registered before the geographical name was protected in its country of origin.', u'Although Article 24(5)(b) may serve to expedite the process of implementing these provisions in developing countries, it still gives an unwarranted advantage to the countries which have long recognized geographical indications.', u'Article 24(4) addresses the question of parallel use of geographical names for wines and spirits; it is tantamount to an acknowledgment that TRIPS does not and cannot reverse past developments in the field.', u'Article 24(9) is also noteworthy because it contains an exception from the National Treatment concept and a restriction of the protectible indications which is not part of the trademark section. Even if the public in one country (Forum 1) identifies a geographical name with its region of origin in another country (Forum 2) so that use of a false indication would mislead the public, TRIPS does not require Forum 1 to protect the indication as long as it is not protected in Forum 2.', u'Problems of National Treatment', u'Under the Romanistic approach, the protectible names must be defined by a legislative, adminis- trative, or judicial act. Names which are not addressed by special regulations are protected against unfair competition, but that protection may not be applied as strictly because all the national products are covered by another strict regime.', u'Another problem concerns the fact that knowledge of geography becomes important if public opinion is to determine whether or not a name is eligible for protection as a geographical indication. The public will presumably be more familiar with domestic geography than with foreign, and is thus much more likely to find domestic names geographically descriptive or misdescriptive than foreign names.', u'CoNCLUSION', u'The TRIPS provisions are designed to protect geographical indications from three abuses: first, the use of false or misleading geographical indications; second, the registration of geographical indications as trademarks; and third, the dilution of geographical indications into generic terms.', u'THE LISBON ARRANGEMENT', u'Lisbon Arrangement establishes a system for international registration of appellations of origin.', u'After filing and obtaining protection of an appellation of origin in their home country, producers may deposit the application with WIPO and seek extension of that protection in all countries that are members of the Lisbon Arrangement.', u'Countries in which extended protection is sought have one year in which to raise objections under Article 5(4), and are given some latitude to determine whether, under their own laws, protection should be granted. But once the one-year period has expired without objection, the appellation of origin will be protected in the additional countries. Article 6 requires that, once registered, members are prohibited from deeming the term generic provided that it remains protected in its country of', u'origin. Any conflicting trademark usages of the protected geographical indication (even prior usages) must cease within two years. See ari. 5(6).', u'dispute over the BUDWEISER v. Budejovicky Budvar', u'Budejovicky Budvar is a brewery based in the town of Budweis, Czech Republic', u', and the beer sold by Budejovicky Budvar came to be known as BUDWEISER, a term which the company has used on its beer since then.', u'Anheuser-Busch is a U.S. producer of beer which it markets under the trademark BUDWEISER; American BUDWEISER beer does not come from the Czech town, although the inspiration for the name came from there.', u'BUDWEISER is a Czech-originated appellation of origin registered in Israel under the Lisbon Arrangement, in the name of Budejovicky Budvar.', u'The Israeli Supreme Court held that, under the Israeli statute implementing the Lisbon Arrangement, as long as the appellation is protected in the country of origin, Anheuser-Busch cannot contest the validity of the appellation of origin.', u'The Israeli Budweiser litigation is pari of an ongoing worldwide dispute between the two companies, some of the different parts of which we have seen above in this chapter.', u'whether and how the United States might incorporate protection for geographical indications into its law, bear in mind that the term BUDWEISER is a registered appellation of origin and that Anheuser-Busch owns trademark rights in that term for beer in the United States.', u'NAFTA AND TRIPS IMPLEMENTATION', u'The United States implemented its NAFTA obligations with respect to geographical indications primarily by amending the Lanham Act to make the bar on primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive marks absolute (section 2(e)(3)), rather than conditional upon secondary', u'meaning.', u'the United States adopted the position that the protection afforded by the Lanham Act and the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) satisfied its obligations with respect to geographical indications under TRIPS and the NAFTA.', u'The Use of "Type" or "Style."', u'One of the important provisions of the Lisbon Arrangement is that under Article 3, signatory states must prevent unauthorized use of the appellation of origin even if it is accompanied by terms like "type" or "style."', u'EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ( v. U.S.) -- PROTECTION OF TRADEMARKS AND GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND FOODSTUFFS', u'European Union Regulations', u'GERMANY AND DENMARK v. COMMISSION 2006 E.T.M.R. 200 (ECJ 2005)', u'It is also common ground that \'\'feta" is not the name ofa region, place or country within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of the basic regulation. Accordingly, the term cannot be registered as a designation of origin pursuant to that provision.', u'Article 2(3) of the basic regulation, moreover, in referring to the second indent of Article 2(2)(a) of the same regulation, requires that the quality or characteristics of the agricultural product or foodstuff be essentially or exclusively due to a particular geographical environment with its inherent natural and human factors, and that the production, processing and preparation of that product take place in the defined geographical area.', u'to define the geographical area covered by reference, inter alia, to geomorphology, that is, the mountainous or semi-mountainous nature of the terrain; to the climate, that is, mild winters, hot summers and a great deal of sunshine; and to the botanicatypical vegetation of the Balkan medium mountain range.', u'Those factors adequately indicate that the area has homogenous natural features', u'which distinguish it from the adjoining areas.', u'The case-file indicates that the areas of Greece which are excluded from the defined area do not display the same natural features as the area in question. It is thus apparent that the area in question in the present case was not determined in an artificial manner.', u'The Danish Government submits that . . . when a name is generic in nature from the beginning, or has subsequently become so, it remains so permanently and irrevocably', u'the definition of the geographi- cal area of production based on traditional practices was established. In 1994, Ministerial Order No 313025 codified all of the rules applicable to feta cheese.', u'the fact that a product has been lawfully marketed under a name in some Member States may constitute a factor which must be taken into account in the assessment of whether that name has become generic within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the basic regulation.', u'the production of feta commenced in 1972 in Germany, in 1931 in France and in the 1930s in Denmark.', u'the cheese thus produced could be lawfully marketed, even in Greece, at least until 1988.', u'the production of feta has remained concentrated in Greece.', u'The fact that the product has been lawfully produced in Member States other than the Hellenic Republic is only one factor of several which must be taken into account pursuant to Article 3(1) of the basic regulation.', u'the Court notes that the 19th recital in the preamble to the contested regulation indicates that more than 85% of Community consumption of feta, per capita and per year, takes place in Greece.', u'the majority of consumers in Greece consider that the name "feta" carries a geographical and not a generic connotation.', u'feta is commonly marketed with labels referring to Greek cultural traditions and civilisation.', u'It is legitimate to infer therefrom that consumers in those Member States perceive feta as a cheese associated with the Hellenic Republic, even if in reality it has been produced in another Member State.', u'Those various factors relating to the consumption of feta in the Member States tend to indicate that the name \'\'feta" is not generic in nature.', u'The Danish legislation does not refer to "feta" but to "Danish feta," which would tend to suggest that in Denmark the name "feta," by itself, has retained a Greek connotation.', u'It follows that, as a whole, the relevant national legislation tends to indicate that the name \'\'feta" is not generic.', u'The Court dismissed the application by Denmark and Germany and upheld the registration of FETA in the contested regulation', u'Article 12 of the 1992 regulation made the registration system available to groups from non-EU countries provided both (1) that the group could provide guarantees of product and indication control that mirror those required of EU groups, and (2) that the non-EU country provided equivalent protection to the name as that available in the EU.', u'Report of the Panel, European Communities - Protection of Trade- marks and Geographical Indications for Agricultural Products and Foodstuffs, WT/ DS174/R (Mar. 15, 2005)', u'The panel found that certain aspects of the system by which geographical indications were obtained and examined did not provide national treatment to non-EU nationals, and in fact were dependent upon reciprocal protection in the non-EU state, in violation of the national treatment provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.', u'The application must include a product "specification."', u'As with terms registered under the simplified procedure, producers may only use a protected designation of origin or geographical indication with an agricnitural product or foodstuff if their product complies with the applicable specification.

ASDA STORES LTD [2003] C.M.L.R. 21 (ECJ 2003)', u'In registering the PDO "Prosciutto di Parma," Regulation 1107/96 thus makes slicing and packaging in the region of production a condition for the use of the PDO "Prosciutto di Parma" for ham marketed in slices.', u'Those rules thus have the specific effect of restricting patterns of exports of ham eligible for the PDO "Prosciutto di Parma" and thereby establishing a difference in treatment between the domestic trade of a Member State and its export trade.', u'They therefore introduce quantitative restrictions on exports within the meaning of Art. 29 EC.', u'Other Regional and Bilateral Agreements', u'Revision of TRIPS Pursuant to Articles 23-24', u'Developments in WIPO', u'DISPUTES BETWEEN STATES', u'DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN WIPO-ADMINISTERED TREATIES', u'Both of the leading pre-TRIPS multilateral intellectual property conventions, the Paris Convention and the Berne Convention, made provision for the submission of disputes to the International Court of Justice. See Berne Convention art. 33(1); Paris Convention art. 28(1).', u'This mechanism was never used. Moreover, no state invoked the doctrine of retaliation (sometimes called "reprisals" = you do something wrong to me, I do something wrong to you) and retorsion ( = if you don\'t do favor for me, i don\'t do a favor for you) under public international law, as a state could have done if it believed au other country was in violation of its treaty obligations.', u'UNILATERAL TRADE MEASURES', u'The United States: Special 301', u'KIM NEWBY, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SPECIAL 301 IN CREATING LONG TERM COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FOR U.S. COMPANIES OVERSEAS 21 SYRACUSE J.
