Around July 2013, a business idea that had been floating around my thoughts for 
a couple of months finally took stage: centralize food delivery in Manhattan, 
finish delivery orders faster and with less delivery personell, and earn some 
percentage of the savings returned to food vendors.  The viability assessment 
of this opportunity comprised three steps:

1. Quantify the gross market cost for delivery services in a particular area;
2. Develop a method for optimizing a delivery service; and
3. Qualify competition and barriers to entry.

Ultimately the opportunity was so appealing I quit my job as a Manhattan litigator 
and pursued it for about 12 months.  I learned a great deal about starting a company, 
software development and project management, marketing, and other lessons and 
insight and personal growth.  But, the business has yet to get off the ground.  
While weighing this and other opportunities, considering other life paths, and 
continuing to develop software on a daily basis, this blog will eventually 
memorialize my experiences and developments with particular emphasis on technical know-how.
