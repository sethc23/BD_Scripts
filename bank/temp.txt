Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Effective July 21, 2011, if we place holds on checks deposited to your account, the minimum amount made available to you by the next business day increases from $100 to $200. Funds from check deposits are generally available to you no later than the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. However, in some cases we place a hold on funds that you deposit by check.Deposit AccountsHSETH T CHASEAccount Number Beginning Balance on 06-22-11Deposits and Other Additions ATM and Debit Card Subtractions Service Charges and Other Fees Other SubtractionsEnding Balance on 07-20-11Combined StatementPage 2 of 6	004608102966 Statement Period 06-22-11 through 07-20-11 B 13 E A E PA 13Number of checks enclosed: 0CampusEdge CheckingSETH T CHASEYour Account at a Glance0046 0810 2966$ +- - - $1,651.41 3,848.12 2,809.3717.95 132.99 2, 539. 22Your account has overdraft protection provided by Deposit A ccount number 0046 0810 3677.Date Posted Amount($)CampusEdge Checking Additions and SubtractionsResulting Balances($) Transactions06-23 06-2306-23 06-24 06-2406-24 06-2706-2706-2706-2706-2706-2706-27 06-2806-28200.00- 2.39-0.61- 105.00- 22.75-0.25- 200.00-104.00- 40.00- 33.40- 17.58-6.21-1.81- 38.01-8.97-1,451.41 1,449.021,448.41 1,343.41 1,320.661,320.41 1,120.411,016.41976.41943.01925.43919.22917.41 879.40870.43BkofAmerica ATM 06/23 #000002652 Withdrwl 29 Broadway	New York	NY Duane Reade IN 06/23 #000101446 Purchase Duane Reade Inc.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.

Please call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to tell us about a change of address.Deposit Agreement. When you opened your account, you received a deposit agreement and fee schedule and agreed that your account would be governed by the terms of these documents, as we may amend them from time to time. These documents are part of the contract for your deposit account and govern all transactions relating to your account, including all deposits and withdrawals. Copies of both the deposit agreement and fee schedule, which contain the current version of the terms and conditions of your account relationship, may be obtained at our banking centers.Electronic Transfers: In case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers If you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about an electronic transfer (e.g., ATM transactions, direct deposits or withdrawals, point-of-sale transactions) on the statement or receipt, telephone or write us at the address and number listed on the front of this statement as soon as you can. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.* Tell us your name and account number. * Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information. * Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. For consumer accounts used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, we will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (10 calender days if you are a Massachusetts customer) (20 business days if you are a new customer, for electronic transfers occurring during the first 30 days after the first deposit is made to your account) to do this, we will recredit your account for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.For other accounts, we investigate, and if we find we have made an error, we credit your account at the conclusion of our investigation.Reporting Other Problems. You must examine your statement carefully and promptly. You are in the best position to discover errors and unauthorized transactions on your account. If you fail to notify us in writing of suspected problems or unauthorized transactions within the time periods specified in the deposit agreement (which periods are no more than 60 days after we make the statement available to you and in some cases are 30 days or less), we are not liable to you for, and you agree not to make a claim against us for the problems or unauthorized transactions.Direct Deposits. If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least once every 60 days from the same person or company, you may call us at the telephone number listed on the front of this statement to find out if the deposit was made as scheduled.Bank of America, N.A.
